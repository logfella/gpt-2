Yoshida said, "Arambati",
the son of the Devas,
is a fool
Yoshida didn't believe him.
Yoshida went up to heaven.
There he sits before the fire,
heaven is empty
The bird is still bathing
in the lake
Rama is not there,
no, not at all

The empty chair

The water is red
And the dog, too

The empty chair

The moon does not rise
In the east,
Is not on the ship

No, good lord,
I am a fish
(It doesn't matter)
The buddha
hides himself
Into nothing

Yoshida is just a boy
Yoshida doesn't know
Yoga

The boy in the water
Says no
Indicates
The Buddha says
By saying the sutras
The bell rings ten times

Not a buddha
Hides himself
Into thin air
The dog yawns

The bell still rings

Buddha
doesn't live here
In the firmament
Yogurt
In the hot sun
Buddha's body burned
In the lake
Buddha
doesn't touch clouds
In the ocean

The Buddha
is a shrivelled nut
In the lake
Buddha sits up straight
On the staff
God loves everyone

The sun is
not yet up
In the clouds
Aoba and the fox
Exhale
In harmony
Buddha

Does not exist
Yuck!
Yea, you're right
In other words
He does exist,
But he's a ghost

On the tree –
There goes the tail

A woman walks past a billboard for a campaign for a "Free Berlin" political party that has been held at a Berlin park since last November

The year is 2016 and some of us think about 2016. We see the same signs from the same year: "Fremdums for Merkel," say those German socialists, as do many others. We see the same tired memes, the same old jokes about German history (I just saw the movie), the same old anti-Mitte adverts: one says "Don't let anyone tell the truth," another urges: "Take a bath with your left feet." Nothing new.

But some people did think in those olden times

Back then there were no billboards

One woman said: "When the world turns grey I don't see the Berlin wall anymore"

In the summer

people dressed as demons and rode motorbikes

in the stormy winter night

The white whale

ROamed the seas
With desire!

began to appear
on the grassy hillside
When I knocked two ways

Wait a minute! There is

Broken glass

Mysterious words

Full moon.

Two little sparrows

The sky the same color

Aurora Borealis

The emptiness remains

November how nasal

Is to me

The moon is clear

Hot chocolate with milk

Walking over the water
my cat’s out

Poor tortured soul

Looking right
In that awful purple canyon

The violet petals
have fallen asleep
And the quiet spring night

Blizzard in the suburbs

hurryingly climbs on the radiator
Booming air conditioner

Is eating grass

Mist falling
Purple flowers
Coming alive

Mist before the dawn

The mug of hot cocoa

Water from the ocean

Mist before the dawn

With a mule

Spring moon

Red roses

The regular fucking pattern

The mist before the dawn

Mist before the dawn

Laughing her head off

The houseflies

Like idiot creams

Cloud tops too cold

Toate a term

The white clouds

And the angels giggle

On Tom Sawyer
I knew better
Than to swim with the current

The starfish
in the grass
No, more like

The rings on my finger
are only
A fig leaf

The grass is still green
the rings don’t

The moon, like
a sutra, divides
My divided mind

The rain makes me
sad, the sun
Angrily laughing

The trees are putting on
Menř armor,
So I guess

Holding up my right
hand, the Buddha
Looks up at the Sky

Spreading out
his arms,
the bedspread
Becomes the Crystal Gate

Ah, the crickets
are screaming
at their sky-ho!

Full moon
Pine tree
Old house

The days go
They cant stay
I don’t realize

Dawn – crows cawing,
ducks quack quacking,
Kitchen windows lighting

My cat’s asleep
poor little angel,
the burden of flesh!

The Dao gives way
To Night

Beer can over

The silence is too great

The trees
sitting still
In the moonlight

"You," I say
"You,"
Said that to yourself

December
9 am
The cat
wasn’t home

The trees
sitting
In the silence

I should have scratched
that spot before
I started to sleep

Man – nothing
but
My imagination

I woke up
Two flies
Backing up

A bird
on the porch
Feeling pretty

Some trees
bowing
In the wind

Shooting star!
as night
Everything is still

A bird
on the grassy hill
A thousand things can change

You’d be surprised
how little I knew
Even up to a week

The sound of silence
makes my blood
Run cold

A gunshot,
a grenade,
A mushroom

Shooting star!

A million acres
of Bo-trees
And not one Buddha

Summer afternoon
impatiently chewing
The jasmine leaf

Poor tortured teeth
under
The blue sky

Autumn nite
my mother cuts her throat

Sun on the rocks
a fighting snag
Holds on

A car is coming but
the cat knows
It's not a snake

Mist falling
Purple flowers
Growing

Drunk as a hoot owl
writing letters
By thunderstorm

You paid yr homage
to the moon,
And she sank

All day long wearing
a hat that wasn't
On my head

Morning sun
The purple petals,
Four have fallen

Cold gray tufts
of winter grass
Under the stars

Phantom Rose
Lust
Is a Leopard

Bird was gone
and distance grew
Immensely white

A bird pecking kernels
on a grassy hillside
Just mowed

O for
Vermont again
The barn on an Autumn night

Drizzle
Midnight pine,
I sit dry

The cat: a little
body being used
By a little person

The creamer gives,
the groaner quakes
the angel smiles

Abbid abbayd ingrat
Lighthouse
On the Azores

Wet fog

In lamplit leaves

Peeking at the moon
in January, Bodhisattva
Takes a secret piss

Samsara in the morning
puppy yipping,
Hot motor steaming

In the late afternoon
peaks, I see
The hope

The trees, already
bent in the windless
Oklahoma plain

The full moon
the cat gone
My sleeping mother

Walking over the water
my shadow,
Heavier than lead

The racket of the starlings
in the trees
My cat’s back

After a year and a half
finally saw the rat
Big and fat

I said a joke
under the stars
No laughter

In the middle of
the corn, a new
Car slithering

Men and women
Yakking beneath
the eternal Void

Wooden house
raw gray
Pink light in the window

I called Hanshan
in the mountains
there was no answer

The bird came
to sit in my flower,
Smashed to pieces

Kicked the can
and it fell
On top of the Antonio

Salvation Army sign
On the wall
An old friend

The treetops

Brightly

Interpreted as a poem

Loves himself

October night,
full moon
Silent house

Spring day
in my mind
Nothing

Full moon in the
moon garden
Silent stream

The wind sent
a leaf on
the robin’s back

I called – Dipankara
instructed me
By saying nothing

Nirbhāṇaya – the fruit
Of his labours
Limestone Buddha

Haiku my eyes!
my mother is calling!

The house where I
was born,
full of birds

One bird
on each shoulder
Spring night

A lull in the
bird song,
A leaf falling

Late afternoon
the little sparrow
On my eave drainpipe

Three pencils arranged
straight down
In the night

Three leaves falling
On the desk
Late night

The sun feels
like gold on my skin
In the blue sky

I called – Dipankara
instructed me
By scratching

The trick of the Haiku – stop
screwing
Writing

Fiddlydee!
Another day,
Another something-or-other!

The racket of
the sea-climates
In the empty sky

Debris on the beach
my back – sand

Everything is okay
my mother talks
To me

Moth sleeping
on the newly plastered wall

The silence of the
pine woods, death

Dusk boy
on a pine log

The squeaking of the cat
on a winter's day

The bird shelter I’m in the middle
Of Europe

Me, my pipe,
my folded legs
In the middle east

Far away
the distant rumble
Of the thunderstorm

Every leaf in the
Razortree
Is green

Mist boiling from the
ridge the mountains
Are clean

The dregs of my
Faint coffee
Glistening on the end

A current pimple
Breaking out
On the forehead

And as for Henry
in Autumn he slept
By swishing heomen

A bird sleeping
on a branch in the wind
The old cat

Some one gently rocking
On the swaying throne
The air is still

Some one gently
shaking the two young
Buddhas on the mountain

The blizzard in the mountains
the child rocking
On the seventeenth day

Autumn night
Lilacs in the new moon
My cat calling

Well here I am,
9:30 last
Night – the Ex

My cat walking
the empty lot
In the morning rain

Lilacs at dawn –

Lonesly leads the life of
Avinokkha

Ah the birds
at dawn,
my mother and father

Hot coffee – what could be
Good for? Sun? Frogs?

Cradled and warm,

Look like me?

Move as fast as a sparrow?

The spider’s non-comment

Everlastingly loose

The cloud business

Like familiar meat

Racing westward through

White rose with red

Content, the top trees
shrouded
In gray fog

Sometimes they sleep
with their lights on,
the June bugs

Water in a hole

The soddden skies

Walking down the road

An old dream
the same dream.

A thing with hairs,

Pool of wax

Why explain?

Walks in the grass
With his tail up in the air

Second thundershower
