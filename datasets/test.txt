The only problem is, I don't have any friends.
No one I know is into music or dancing or smoking pot or having kids or going to parties.
I don't even really like to think about it.
I just sort of am.
Then again, maybe it's because I haven't had kids.
Maybe it's the womanly duty it imposes.
Maybe it's the bonus estrogen.
I don't know. Maybe it's just how I am.

I don't know. Maybe it's the fact that it's still early enough in the morning that it hasn't quite hit me:
is there any way I can be more woman than I am now?

I thank the gods
that I do not have
multiple personalities.
It's hard enough keeping up
with this one.

On the importance of flossing

When you're older
you realize
that it isn't so bad
just stop being so stupid
and live your life
like it's the twenty-first century
and not the fifteenth.
One day you will be an old, 
well-read, and highly-respected person
I just hope you will still have
some teeth left.

Nothing

This poem is about nothing.
This is what poetry is, essentially.
Nothing special about these words,
I just thought they look good together.
I'm going to type up a book of them
and people are going to love them
and I'm going to be really happy
because then I will have done something worthwhile
and I shall no longer be sad.

Bars

Bars are like houses that you pay money to go to
The food is good but only if you ask nicely
The lights are dim and the rooms are filled with smoke
It kinda makes you feel like you're in a trance
Or maybe it's the alcohol
My eyes wander everywhere to find you
But you are not here tonight. And I respect that.
The bartender drags his shoe as he moves, leaving a creak behind

My heart

I am an elephant
Your mind is my trunk
I am a forest
Your mind is my tree
I am me
Your mind is my heart
When I die
Your mind will find its way
To the door of my head
Your mind will find its way
To my heart

--------------------

Social media

I am an addict
I have filled my mind and my body
with these social creations
And everytime you smash that like button
I know I have nowhere to run
You see, I used to take pride
In my skills
Now I wish I was wiser
Still, I like the feeling
That I'm at least trying
Still, I wish I could tell you
That we can make it
Because when I see you driving by
I wish I could see you smile
Just so I could do the same
Just like the drugs
We're all smoke
The clouds hiding the truth

--------------------

People

The streets are full of lights
And little lanes are all filled
With little trucks full of people
With places to go and smiles to show
They've never had to work so hard
And while their shoes are all worn-out
And their heads are full of doubt
They imagine what lies ahead is filled with joy
Thoughts of the past are replaced with prayers for the future

There comes a time in every young person's life  
When they have to make a choice  
Do I still want to be a rock star?  
Or do I want to become one of *those* people?  
For me the choice was simple   
I really wanted to become the former so I became nothing  

For those people who only ever wished they were rock stars  
That choice was very painful  
Always looking for someone to please  
I had no one to turn to for comfort and guidance  
So I chose to become a blank canvas  
Just another blank canvas  
I painted my darkest thoughts and fears onto it  
And I understood what depression really is about  
That it was simply the cost of wanting to please so badly  
This is when I realized the path I chose was so wrong  
There is a price to be paid for wanting so very much  
And I had no intention of paying it  

So, one day, I went to the art store and bought a blank canvas  
And I spent the next few weeks painting my dark thoughts and fears onto it

I'm not sure if I like spiders.
They're small, and I guess they're kind, and they like to rest.
I mean, really, they LIKE to rest.
They spend most of the days just sitting there, minding their own business.
But there's one spider that I really got on my mind.
The one that crawled up into my head and took up residence.
Its web is entwined deep inside of me.

The more I think about it, the more I like spiders.
They are kind and they are gentle.
But once in a while,
They will weave their webs,
In your head,
Around your neck,
And your heart.
