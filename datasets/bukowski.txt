A Following

the phone rang at 1:30 a.m.
and it was a man from Denver:

<|endoftext|>

A Man

<|endoftext|>

A Radio With Guts

it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
I used to get drunk

and throw the radio through the window
while it was playing, and, of course,
it would break the glass in the window
and the radio would sit there on the roof
still playing

and I'd tell my woman,

"Ah, what a marvelous radio !"
the next morning I'd take the window
off the hinges

and carry it down the street

to the glass man

who would put in another pane.

I kept throwing that radio through the window

each time I got drunk

and it would sit there on the roof

still playing-

a magic radio

a radio with guts,

and each morning I'd take the window
back to the glass man.

I don't remember how it ended exactly
though I do remember
we finally moved out.

there was a woman downstairs who worked in

the garden in her bathing suit,

she really dug with that trowel

and she put her behind up in the air

and I used to sit in the window

and watch the sun shine all over that thing

while the music played.

<|endoftext|>

a smile to remember

we had goldfish and they circled around and around

in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes

covering the picture window and

my mother, always smiling, wanting us all

to be happy, told me, "be happy Henry!"

and she was right: it's better to be happy if you

can

but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
understand what was attacking him from within.

my mother, poor fish,

wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a
week, telling me to be happy: "Henry, smile!
why don't you ever smile?"

and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the
saddest smile I ever saw

one day the goldfish died, all five of them,
they floated on the water, on their sides, their
eyes still open,

and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
smiled

Alone With Everybody

the flesh covers the bone
and they put a mind
in there and
sometimes a soul,
and the women break
vases against the walls
and the men drink too
much

and nobody finds the
one

but keep
looking

crawling in and out
of beds,
flesh covers
the bone and the
flesh searches
for more than
flesh.

there's no chance
at all:

we are all trapped
by a singular
fate.

nobody ever finds
the one.

the city dumps fill
the junkyards fill
the madhouses fill
the hospitals fill
the graveyards fill

nothing else
fills.

An Almost Made Up Poem

I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny

blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny

they are small, and the fountain is in France

where you wrote me that last letter and

I answered and never heard from you again.

you used to write insane poems about

ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you

knew famous artists and most of them

were your lovers, and I wrote back, it&#146; all right,

go ahead, enter their lives, I&#146; not jealous

because we&#146; never met. we got close once in

New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never

touched, so you went with the famous and wrote

about the famous, and, of course, what you found out

is that the famous are worried about

their fame &#150;&#150; not the beautiful young girl in bed

with them, who gives them that, and then awakens

in the morning to write upper case poems about

ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they&#146; told

us, but listening to you I wasn&#146; sure, maybe

it was the upper case, you were one of the

best female poets and I told the publishers,

editors, &#147; her, print her, she&#146; mad but she&#146;

magic. there&#146; no lie in her fire. &# 148; I loved you

like a man loves a woman he never touches, only

writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have

loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a

cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,

but that didn&#146; happen, your letters got sadder.

your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all

lovers betray, it didn&#146; help, you said

you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and

the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying

bench every night and wept for the lovers who had

hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never

heard again, a friend wrote me of your suicide

3 or 4 months after it happened, if I had met you

I would probably have been unfair to you or you

to me. it was best like this.

Another Day

having the low down blues and going

into a restraunt to eat.

you sit at a table.

the waitress smiles at you.

she's dumpy, her ass is too big.

she radiates kindess and symphaty.

live with her 3 months and a man would no real agony.

o.k., you'll tip her 15 percent.

you order a turkey sandwich and a

beer.

the man at the table across from you

has watery blue eyes and

a head like an elephant.

at a table further down are 3 men

with very tiny heads

and long necks

like ostiches.

they talk loudly of land development,
why, you think, did I ever come
in here when I have the low-down
blues?

then the the waitress comes back eith the sandwich

and she asks you if there will be anything

else?

snd you tell her, no no, this will be
fine.

then somebody behind you laughs,
it's a cork laugh filled with sand and
broken glass.

you begin eating the sandwhich.

it's something,
it's a minor, difficult,
sensible action

like composing a popular song
to make a 14-year old
weep.

you order another beer.
jesus,look at that guy

his hands hang down almost to his knees and he's
whistling.

well, time to get out.
pivk up the bill,
tip.

go to the register,
pay.

pick up a toothpick.

go out the door.

your car is still there.

and there are 3 men with heads

and necks

<|endoftext|>

like ostriches all getting into one
car.

they each have a toothpick and now
they are talking about women,
they drive away first
they drive away fast,
they're best i guess,
it's an unberably hot day.
there's a first-stage smog alert,
all the birds and plants are dead
or dying.

you start the engine.

Are You Drinking?

washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook
out again

I write from the bed
as I did last
year.

will see the doctor,

Monday.

"yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-
aches and my back
hurts. "

"are you drinking?" he will ask.
"are you getting your
exercise, your
vitamins?"

I think that I am just ill
with life, the same stale yet
fluctuating
factors.

even at the track
I watch the horses run by
and it seems
meaningless.

I leave early after buying tickets on the
remaining races.

"taking off?" asks the motel
clerk.

"yes, it's boring, "

I tell him.

"If you think it's boring

out there, " he tells me, "you oughta be

back here."

so here I am

propped up against my pillows
again

just an old guy

just an old writer

with a yellow

notebook.

something is

walking across the

floor

toward

me.

oh, it's just
my cat

As The Sparrow

To give life you must take life,
and as our grief falls flat and hollow
upon the billion-blooded sea

I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.
Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.

I hated you when it would have taken less courage
to love.

<|endoftext|>

back to the machine gun

I awaken about noon and go out to get the mail
in my old torn bathrobe.

I'm hung over

hair down in my eyes

barefoot

gingerly walking on the small sharp rocks
in my path

still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard.

the young housewife next door shakes a rug
out of her window and sees me:

"hello, Hank!"

god damn! it's almost like being shot in the ass
with a .22

"hello," I say

gathering up my Visa card bill, my Pennysaver coupons,

a Dept, of Water and Power past-due notice,

a letter from the mortgage people

plus a demand from the Weed Abatement Department

giving me 30 days to clean up my act.

I mince back again over the small sharp rocks
thinking, maybe I'd better write something tonight,
they all seem
to be closing in.

there's only one way to handle those motherfuckers,
the night harness races will have to wait.

Big Night On The Town

drunk on the dark streets of some city,
it's night, you're lost, where's your
room?

you enter a bar to find yourself,
order scotch and water,
damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks
part of one of your shirt
sleeves.

It's a clip joint-the scotch is weak,
you order a bottle of beer.

Madame Death walks up to you

wearing a dress.

she sits down, you buy her a

beer, she stinks of swamps, presses

a leg against you.

the bar tender sneers.

you've got him worried, he doesn't

know if you're a cop, a killer, a

madman or an

Idiot.

you ask for a vodka.

you pour the vodka into the top of

the beer bottle.

It's one a.m. In a dead cow world,
you ask her how much for head,
drink everything down, it tastes
like machine oil.

you leave Madame Death there,
you leave the sneering bartender
there.

you have remembered where
your room is.

the room with the full bottle of
wine on the dresser,
the room with the dance of the
roaches.

Carson McCullers

she died of alcoholism
wrapped in a blanket
on a deck chair
on an ocean
steamer.

all her books of
terrified loneliness

all her books about
the cruelty
of loveless love

were all that was left
of her

as the strolling vacationer
discovered her body

notified the captain

and she was quickly dispatched
to somewhere else
on the ship

as everything
continued just
as

she had written it

<|endoftext|>

Cause And Effect

close to greatness

at one stage in my life
I met a man who claimed to have
visited Pound at St. Elizabeths.

then I met a woman who not only
claimed to have visited

E.P.

but also to have made love
to him— she even showed
me

certain sections in the
Cantos

where Ezra was supposed to have

mentioned

her.

so there was this man and
this woman

and the woman told me
that Pound had never
mentioned a visit from this
man

and the man claimed that the
lady had had nothing to do
with the
master

that she was a
charlatan

and since I wasn't a
Poundian scholar
I didn't know who to
believe

but one thing I do
know: when a man is
living

many claim relationships
that are hardly
so

and after he dies, well,
then it's everybody's
party.

my guess is that Pound
knew neither the lady or the
gentleman

or if he knew
one

or if he knew
both

<|endoftext|>

it was a shameful waste of

madhouse

time.

Confession

waiting for death
like a cat

that will jump on the
bed

I am so very sorry for
my wife

she will see this

stiff

white

body

shake it once, then

maybe

again

"Hank!"

Hank won't
answer.

it's not my death that
worries me, it's my wife
left with this
pile of
nothing.

I want to
let her know
though

that all the nights
sleeping
beside her

even the useless
arguments
were things
ever splendid

and the hard
words

I ever feared to
say

can now be
said:

I love
you.

<|endoftext|>

Consummation Of Grief

I even hear the mountains

the way they laugh

up and down their blue sides

and down in the water

the fish cry

and the water

is their tears.

I listen to the water

on nights I drink away

and the sadness becomes so great

I hear it in my clock

it becomes knobs upon my dresser

it becomes paper on the floor

it becomes a shoehorn

a laundry ticket

it becomes

cigarette smoke

climbing a chapel of dark vines. . .

it matters little

very little love is not so bad

or very little life

what counts

is waiting on walls

I was born for this

I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.

Curtain

the final curtain on one of the longest running
musicals ever, some people claim to have
seen it over one hundred times.

I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain:
flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous
accolade.

I have not seen this particular musical
but I know if I had that I wouldn't have
been able to bear it, it would have
sickened me.

trust me on this, the world and its
peoples and its artful entertainment has
done very little for me, only to me.
still, let them enjoy one another, it will
keep them from my door
and for this, my own thunderous
accolade.

Cut While Shaving

It's never quite right, he said, the way people look,
the way the music sounds, the way the words are
written.

It's never quite right, he said, all the things we are

taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we

die, all the lives we live,

they are never quite right,

they are hardly close to right,

these lives we live

one after the other,

piled there as history,

the waste of the species,

the crushing of the light and the way,

it's not quite right,

it's hardly right at all

he said.

don't I know it? I
answered.

I walked away from the mirror.

it was morning, it was afternoon, it was

night

nothing changed
it was locked in place.

something flashed, something broke, something
remained.

I walked down the stairway and
into it.

Death Wants More Death

death wants more death, and its webs are full:

I remember my father's garage, how child-like

I would brush the corpses of flies

from the windows they thought were escape-

their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies

shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass

only to spin and flit

in that second larger than hell or heaven
onto the edge of the ledge,
and then the spider from his dank hole
nervous and exposed
the puff of body swelling
hanging there
not really quite knowing,
and then knowing-
something sending it down its string,
the wet web,

toward the weak shield of buzzing,
the pulsing;

a last desperate moving hair-leg

there against the glass

there alive in the sun,

spun in white;

and almost like love:

the closing over,

the first hushed spider-sucking:

filling its sack

upon this thing that lived;

crouching there upon its back

drawing its certain blood

as the world goes by outside

and my temples scream

and I hurl the broom against them:

the spider dull with spider-anger

still thinking of its prey

and waving an amazed broken leg;

the fly very still,

a dirty speck stranded to straw;

I shake the killer loose

and he walks lame and peeved

towards some dark corner

but I intercept his dawdling

his crawling like some broken hero,

and the straws smash his legs

now waving

above his head

and looking

looking for the enemy

and somewhat valiant,

dying without apparent pain

simply crawling backward

piece by piece

<|endoftext|>

leaving nothing there

until at last the red gut sack

splashes

its secrets,

and I run child-like

with God's anger a step behind,

back to simple sunlight,

wondering

as the world goes by
with curled smile
if anyone else
saw or sensed my crime

<|endoftext|>

naked along the side of the house,

8 a.m., spreading sesame seed oil
over my body, Jesus, have I come

I splash myself with oil and wonder,

how many years do you want?

how many days?

my blood is soiled and a dark

angel sits in my brain.

things are made of something and

go to nothing.

I understand the fall of cities, of
nations.

I've come by, she says, to tell you
that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's

I sit on the couch watching her arrange
her long red hair before my bedroom
mirror.

she pulls her hair up and
piles it on top of her head-
she lets her eyes look at
my eyes-

then she drops her hair and

lets it fall down in front of her face.

we go to bed and I hold her

speechlessly from the back

my arm around her neck

I touch her wrists and hands

I want you to buy me
some high-heeled shoes
with tall thin spikes,
black high-heeled shoes,

Eulogy To A Hell Of A Dame

some dogs who sleep At night

wanted to explode out of

rotten memories of a

past, and

you finally got

out

leaving me with the

rotten

present;

you've been dead
28 years

yet I remember you
better than any of
the rest;

you were the only one
who understood
the futility of the
arrangement of
life;

all the others were only
displeased with
trivial segments,
carped

nonsensically about
nonsense;

Freedom

he drank wine all night of the

the way she walked and talked and loved
the way she told him things that seemed true
but were not, and he knew the color of each
of her dresses

and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of
each heel

as well as the leg shaped by it.

and she was out again and when he came home, and
she'd come back with that special stink again,
and she did

she came in at 3 a.m in the morning
filthy like a dung eating swine
and

he took out a butchers knife
and she screamed

backing into the rooming house wall

still pretty somehow

in spite of love's reek

and he finished the glass of wine.

that yellow dress
his favorite

and she screamed again.

and he took up the knife

and unhooked his belt

and tore away the cloth before her

and cut off his balls.

and carried them in his hands
like apricots

and flushed them down the
toilet bowl

and she kept screaming
as the room became red

GOD 0 GOD!

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

and he sat there holding 3 towels
between his legs

no caring now whether she left or
stayed

wore yellow or green or
anything at all.

and one hand holding and one hand
lifting he poured

Friends Within The Darkness

I can remember starving in a
small room in a strange city
shades pulled down, listening to
classical music

I was young I was so young it hurt like a knife
inside

because there was no alternative except to hide as long
as possible--

not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance:
trying to connect.

the old composers — Mozart, Bach, Beethoven,

Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and
they were dead.

finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into
the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and
monotonous
jobs

by strange men behind desks
men without eyes men without faces
who would take away my hours
break them
piss on them.

now I work for the editors the readers the
critics

but still hang around and drink with
Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the
Bee

gamblers all

sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think,

<i>I'm not going to make it</i>, but you laugh inside

remembering all the times you've felt that way, and

you walk to the bathroom, do your toilet, see that face

in the mirror, oh my oh my oh my, but you comb your hair anyway,

get into your street clothes, feed the cats, fetch the

newspaper of horror, place it on the coffee table, kiss your

wife goodbye, and then you are backing the car out into life itself,

like millions of others you enter the arena once more.

you are on the freeway threading through traffic now,

moving both towards something and towards nothing at all as you punch

the radio on and get Mozart, which is something, and you will somehow

get through the slow days and the busy days and the dull

days and the hateful days and the rare days, all both so delightful

and so disappointing because

we are all so alike and so different.

you find the turn-off, drive through the most dangerous
part of town, feel momentarily wonderful as Mozart works
his way into your brain and slides down along your bones and
out through your shoes.

it's been a tough fight worth fighting
as we all drive along
betting on another day.

Girl In A Miniskirt Reading The Bible Outside My Window

Sunday, I am eating a

grapefruit, church is over at the Russian

Orthadox to the

west.

she is dark
of Eastern descent,

large brown eyes look up from the Bible
then down, a small red and black
Bible, and as she reads
her legs keep moving, moving,
she is doing a slow rythmic dance
reading the Bible. . .

long gold earrings;

2 gold bracelets on each arm,
and it's a mini-suit, I suppose,
the cloth hugs her body,
the lightest of tans is that cloth,
she twists this way and that,
long yellow legs warm in the sun. . .

there is no escaping her being
there is no desire to. . .

my radio is playing symphonic music

that she cannot hear

but her movements coincide exactly

to the rythms of the

symphony. . .

she is dark, she is dark
she is reading about God.

I am God.

having the flu and with nothing else to do

I read a book about John Dos Passos and according to
the book once radical-communist

John ended up in the Hollywood Hills living off investments

and reading the

<i > Wall Street Journal </i>

this seems to happen all too often.

what hardly ever happens is

a man going from being a young conservative to becoming an
old wild-ass radical

however:

young conservatives always seem to become old
conservatives.

it's a kind of lifelong mental vapor-lock.

but when a young radical ends up an
old radical
the critics

and the conservatives

treat him as if he escaped from a mental

institution.

such is our politics and you can have it
all.

hello, how are you?

this fear of being what they are:
dead.

at least they are not out on the street, they
are careful to stay indoors, those
pasty mad who sit alone before their tv sets,
their lives full of canned, mutilated laughter.

their ideal neighborhood
of parked cars
of ittle green lawns
of ittle homes

the little doors that open and close
as their relatives visit
throughout the holidays
the doors closing

behind the dying who die so slowly
behind the dead who are still alive
in your quiet average neighborhood
of winding streets
of agony
of confusion
of horror
of fear
of ignorance.

His Wife, The Painter

There are sketches on the walls of men and women and ducks,

Hooray Say The Roses

hooray say the roses, today is blamesday

hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday

and we bloom wher soldiers fell

and lovers too,

and the snake at the word.

hooray say the roses, darkness comes
all at once, like lights gone out,
the sun leaves dark continents
and rows of stone.

hooray say the roses, cannons and spires,

birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday

the hand holding a medal out the window,

hooray say the roses

the sun moves the mouth:

hooray hooray hooray

Hot

she was hot, she was so hot
I didn't want anybody else to have her,
and if I didn't get home on time
she'd be gone, and I couldn't bearthat-
I'd go mad. . .

it was foolish I know, childish,
but I was caught in it, I was caught.

and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run
in an old army truck,

the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run

and the night went on

and jumping in and out of the truck

filling mailsacks

the engine continuing to heat up

the temperature needle was at the top

3 more pickups and into the station
I'd be, my car

waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch

with scotch on the rocks

crossing her legs and swinging her ankles

like she did,

2 more stops. . .

the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell
kicking it over
again. . .

I had to be home by 8,8 was the deadline for Miriam.

I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal
1/2 block from the station. . .
it wouldn't start, it couldn't start. . .

I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the
station. . .

I threw the keys down. . .signed out. . .

How Is Your Heart?

during my worst times
on the park benches
in the jails
or living with
whores

I always had this certain
contentment-
I wouldn't call it
happiness-

it was more of an inner
balance

that settled for
whatever was occuring
and it helped in the
factories

and when relationships
went wrong
with the

I like your books

In the betting line the other
day

man behind me asked,

"are you Henry
Chinaski?"

"uh huh," I answered.

"I like your books," he went
on.

"thanks," I answered.

"who do you like in this
race?" he asked.

"uh uh," I answered.

"I like the 4 horse," he
told me.

I made my bet and went back
to my seat....

the next race I am standing in
line and here is this same man
standing behind me
again.

there are at least 50 lines at
the windows but
he has to find mine
again.

"I think this race favors the
closers," he said to the back of
my neck, "the track looks
heavy."

"listen," I said, not looking
around, "it's the kiss of death to
talk about horses at the
track..."

"what kind of rule is that?"
he asked. "God doesn't make
rules..."

I turned around and looked at him:

"maybe not, but I

do."

after the next race

<|endoftext|>

I got in line, glanced behind
me:

he was not there:

I lose 2 or 3 each

I Met A Genius

I met a genius on the train
today

about 6 years old,

he sat beside me

and as the train

ran down along the coast

we came to the ocean

and then he looked at me

and said,

it's not pretty.

<|endoftext|>

I'm In Love

she's young, she said,
but look at me,

I have pretty ankles,

and look at my wrists, I have pretty

wrists

0 my god,

1 thought it was all working,
and now it's her again,

every time she phones you go crazy,

you told me it was over

you told me it was finished,

listen, I've lived long enough to become a

good woman,

why do you need a bad woman?

you need to be tortured, don't you?

you think life is rotten if somebody treats you

rotten it all fits,

doesn't it?

tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a
piece of shit?

and my son, my son was going to meet you.

I told my son

and I dropped all my lovers.

I stood up in a cafe and screamed
I'M IN LOVE,

and now you've made a fool of me. . .

I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry.

hold me, she said, will you please hold me?

I've never been in one of these things before, I said,
these triangles. . .

she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all
over.she paced up and down, wild and crazy. she had
a small body. her arms were thin, very thin and when
she screamed and started beating me I held her
wrists and then I got it through the eyes: hatred,
centuries deep and true. I was wrong and graceless and
sick. all the things I had learned had been wasted,
there was no creature living as foul as I
and all my poems were
false.

while entranced by
nothing

Layover

Making love in the sun, in the morning sun
in a hotel room
above the alley

where poor men poke for bottles;
making love in the sun

making love by a carpet redder than our blood,
making love while the boys sell headlines
and Cadillacs,

making love by a photograph of Paris
and an open pack of Chesterfields,
making love while other men- poor folks-
work.

That moment- to this. . .

may be years in the way they measure,

but it's only one sentence back in my mind-

there are so many days

when living stops and pulls up and sits

and waits like a train on the rails.

I pass the hotel at 8

and at 5; there are cats in the alleys

and bottles and bums,

and I look up at the window and think,

I no longer know where you are,
and I walk on and wonder where
the living goes
when it stops.

<|endoftext|>

Let It Enfold You

either peace or happiness,
let it enfold you

when I was a young man
I felt these things were
dumb, unsophisticated.

I had bad blood, a twisted
mind, a precarious
upbringing.

I was hard as granite, I

leered at the

sun.

I trusted no man and
especially no
woman.

I was living a hell in
small rooms, I broke
things, smashed things,
walked through glass,
cursed.

I challenged everything,
was continually being
evicted, jailed, in and
out of fights, in and out
of my mind.

women were something
to screw and rail
at, I had no male
freinds,

I changed jobs and
cities, I hated holidays,
babies, history,
newspapers, museums,
grandmothers,
marriage, movies,
spiders, garbagemen,
english accents, Spain,
france,italy, walnuts and
the color
orange.

algebra angred me,
opera sickened me,

Charlie chaplin was a
fake

and flowers were for
pansies.

peace an happiness to me
were signs of

<|endoftext|>

inferiority,

tenants of the weak

an

addled

mind.

but as I went on with
my alley fights,
my suicidal years,
my passage through
any number of
women-it gradually
began to occur to
me

that I wasn't different
from the

others, I was the same,

they were all fulsome

with hatred,

glossed over with petty

greivances,

the men I fought in

alleys had hearts of stone.

everybody was nudging,

inching, cheating for

some insignificant

advantage,

the lie was the

weapon and the

plot was

empty,

darkness was the
dictator.

cautiously, I allowed
myself to feel good
at times.

I found moments of
peace in cheap
rooms

just staring at the
knobs of some
dresser

or listening to the
rain in the
dark.

the less I needed
the better I
felt.

<|endoftext|>

maybe the other life had worn me
down.

I no longer found
glamour

in topping somebody
in conversation,
or in mounting the
body of some poor
drunken female
whose life had
slipped away into
sorrow.

I could never accept
life as it was,
i could never gobble
down all its
Doisons

3ut there were parts,
tenous magic parts
open for the
asking.

I re formulated
I don't know when,
date, time, all
that

but the change
occured.

something in me
relaxed, smoothed
out.

i no longer had to
prove that I was a
man,

I did'nt have to prove
anything.

I began to see things:
coffee cups lined up
behind a counter in a
cafe.

or a dog walking along
a sidewalk.

or the way the mouse
on my dresser top
stopped there
with its body,
its ears,
its nose,
it was fixed,

<|endoftext|>

a bit of life
caught within itself
and its eyes looked
at me

and they were
beautiful,
then- it was
gone.

I began to feel good,

I began to feel good
in the worst situations
and there were plenty
of those.

like say, the boss
behind his desk,
he is going to have
to fire me.

I've missed too many
days.

he is dressed in a
suit, necktie, glasses,
he says, "I am going
to have to let you go"

"it's all right" I tell
him.

He must do what he
must do, he has a
wife, a house, children,
expenses, most probably
a girlfreind.

I am sorry for him
he is caught.

I walk onto the blazing

sunshine.

the whole day is

mine

temporailiy,

anyhow.

(the whole world is at the
throat of the world,
everybody feels angry,
short-changed, cheated,
everybody is despondent,
dissillusioned)

<|endoftext|>

I welcomed shots of
peace, tattered shards of
happiness.

I embraced that stuff
like the hottest number,
like high heels, breasts,
singing, the
works.

(dont get me wrong,

there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism

that overlooks all

basic problems just for

the sake of

itself-

this is a shield and a
sickness.)

The knife got near my
throat again,

I almost turned on the

gas

again

but when the good
moments arrived
again

I did'nt fight them off
like an alley
adversary.

I let them take me,
i luxuriated in them,

I bade them welcome
home.

I even looked into
the mirror

once having thought
myself to be
ugly,

I now liked what
I saw, almost
handsome, yes,
a bit ripped and
ragged,
scares, lumps,
odd turns,
but all in all,
not too bad,
almost handsome,
better at least than
some of those movie
star faces

<|endoftext|>

like the cheeks of

a baby's

butt.

and finally I discovered

real feelings of

others,

unheralded,

like lately,

like this morning,

as I was leaving,

for the track,

i saw my wife in bed,

just the

shape of

her head there

(not forgetting

centuries of the living

and the dead and

the dying,

the pyramids,

Mozart dead

but his music still

there in the

room, weeds growing,

the earth turning,

the toteboard waiting for

me)

I saw the shape of my
wife's head,
she so still,

I ached for her life,
just being there
under the
covers.

I kissed her in the,
forehead,

got down the stairway,

got outside,

got into my marvelous

car,

fixed the seatbelt,
backed out the
drive.

feeling warm to
the fingertips,
down to my
foot on the gas
pedal,

I entered the world
once

<|endoftext|>

more,

drove down the
hill

past the houses
full and empty
of

people,

I saw the mailman,

honked,

he waved

back

at me.

<|endoftext|>

Like A Flower In The Rain

I cut the middle fingernail of the middle

finger

right hand

real short

and I began rubbing along her cunt
as she sat upright in bed
spreading lotion over her arms
face

and breasts

after bathing.

then she lit a cigarette:

"don't let this put you off,"
an smoked and continued to rub
the lotion on.

I continued to rub the cunt.

"You want an apple?" I asked.

"sure, she said, "you got one?"

but I got to her-

she began to twist

then she rolled on her side,

she was getting wet and open

like a flower in the rain.

then she rolled on her stomach

and her most beautiful ass

looked up at me

and I reached under and got the
cunt again.

she reached around and got my
cock, she rolled and twisted,

I mounted

my face falling into the mass
of red hair that overflowed
from her head

and my flattened cock entered

into the miracle.

later we joked about the lotion

and the cigarette and the apple.

then I went out and got some chicken

and shrimp and french fries and buns

and mashed potatoes and gravy and

cole slaw, and we ate. she told me

how good she felt and I told her

how good I felt and we

ate the chicken and the shrimp and the

french fries and the buns and the

mashed potatoes and the gravy and

the cole slaw too.

magical mystery tour

I am in this low-slung sports car
painted a deep, rich yellow

there's no dirt under my

the radio plays Vivaldi

and there are two women with

one with raven hair
the other a blonde,
they have small breasts and
beautiful legs

and they laugh at everything I

as we drive up a steep road

the blonde squeezes my leg

and nestles closer

while raven hair

leans across and nibbles my

ear.

we stop for lunch at a quaint

there is more laughter
before lunch
during lunch and after
lunch.

after lunch we will have a
flat tire on the other side of
the mountain

and the blonde will change the

tire

my father

was a truly amazing man
he pretended to be
rich

even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies
when we sat down to eat, he said,

"not everybody can eat like this."

and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually

thought he was rich

he always voted Republican

and he voted for Hoover against Roosevelt

and he lost

and then he voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt
and he lost again

saying, "I don't know what this world is coming to,
now we've got that god damned Red in there again
and the Russians will be in our backyard next!"

I think it was my father who made me decide to
become a bum.

I decided that if a man like that wants to be rich
then I want to be poor.

and I became a bum.

I lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and
on park benches.

I thought maybe the bums knew something.

but I found out that most of the bums wanted to be
rich too.

they had just failed at that.

so caught between my father and the bums

I had no place to go

and I went there fast and slow.

My First Affair With That Older Woman

when I look back now
at the abuse I took from
her

I feel shame that I was so

innocent,

but I must say

she did match me drink for

drink,

and I realized that her life
her feelings for things
had been ruined
along the way

and that I was no mare than a

temporary

companion;

she was ten years older
and mortally hurt by the past
and the present;
she treated me badly:
desertion, other
men;

she brought me immense
pain,

continually;
she lied, stole;
there was desertion,

<|endoftext|>

other men,

yet we had our moments; and

our little soap opera ended

with her in a coma

in the hospital,

and I sat at her bed

for hours

talking to her,

and then she opened her eyes
and saw me:

"I knew it would be you,"
she said.

then hse closed her
eyes.

the next day she was
dead.

I drank alone
for two years
after that.

My Groupie

I read last Saturday in the
redwoods outside of Santa Cruz
and I was about 3/4's finished
when I heard a long high scream
and a quite attractive
young girl came running toward me
long gown &amp; divine eyes of fire
and she leaped up on the stage
and screamed: "I WANT YOU!
I WANT YOU! TAKE ME! TAKE
ME!"

1 told her, "look, get the hell
away from me."

but she kept tearing at my
clothing and throwing herself
at me.

"where were you," I
asked her, "when I was living
on one candy bar a day and
sending short stories to the
Atlantic Monthly?"
she grabbed my balls and almost
twisted them off. her kisses
tasted like shitsoup.

2 women jumped up on the stage
and

carried her off into the
woods.

I could still hear her screams
as I began the next poem,
mabye, I thought, I should have
taken her on stage in front
of all those eyes,
but one can never be sure
whether it's good poetry or
bad acid.

New Mexico

I was fairly drunk when it

began and I took out my bottle and used it

along the way. I was reading a week or two after

Kandel and I did not look quite as

pretty but

I brought it off and we

ended up at the Webbs, 6, 8, 10 of

us, and I drank scotch, wine, beer, tequila

and noticed a nice one sitting next to me -

one tooth missing when she smiled,

lovely, and I put my arm around her

and began loading her with bullshit, when I awakened at 10 a.m. the next morning
I was in a strange house
in bed with this

woman, she was asleep but looked
familiar.

<|endoftext|>

Now

I sit here on the 2nd floor
hunched over in yellow
pajamas

still pretending to be
a writer.

some damned gall,
at 71,

my brain cells eaten

away by

life.

rows of books
behind me,

I scratch my thinning
hair

and search for the
word.

<|endoftext|>

O, We Are The Outcasts

ah, Christ, what a CREW:
more

poetry, always more
POETRY.

if it doesn't come, coax it out with a
laxative, get your name in LIGHTS,
get it up there in
8 1/2 x 11 mimeo.

keep it coming like a miracle.

ah Christ, writers are the most sickening
of all the louts!

yellow-toothed, slump-shouldered,
gutless, flea-bitten and
obvious ... in tinker-toy rooms
with their flabby hearts
they tell us

what's wrong with the world-

as if we didn't know that a cop's club

can crack the head

and that war is a dirtier game than

marriage ...

or down in a basement bar

hiding from a wife who doesn't appreciate him

and children he doesn't

want

he tells us that his heart is drowning in
vomit, hell, all our hearts are drowning in vomit,
in pork salt, in bad verse, in soggy
love.

but he thinks he's alone and

he thinks he's special and he thinks he's Rimbaud

and he thinks he's

Pound.

and death! how about death? did you know
that we all have to die? even Keats died, even
Milton!

and D. Thomas-THEY KILLED HIM, of course.

Thomas didn't want all those free drinks

all that free pussy-

they . . . FORCED IT ON HIM

when they should have left him alone so he could

write write WRITE!

poets.

and there's another

type. I've met them at their country

places (don't ask me what I was doing there because

<|endoftext|>

I don't know).

they were born with money and
they don't have to dirty their hands in
slaughterhouses or washing
dishes in grease joints or
driving cabs or pimping or selling pot.

this gives them time to understand
Life.

they walk in with their cocktail glass
held about heart high
and when they drink they just
sip.

you are drinking green beer which you
brought with you

because you have found out through the years

that rich bastards are tight-

they use 5 cent stamps instead of airmail

they promise to have all sorts of goodies ready

upon your arrival

from gallons of whisky to

50 cent cigars, but it's never

there.

and they HIDE their women from you-

their wives, x-wives, daughters, maids, so forth,

because they've read your poems and

figure all you want to do is fuck everybody and

everything, which once might have been

true but is no longer quite

true.

and-

he WRITES TOO.

POETRY, of
course, everybody
writes
poetry.

he has plenty of time and a

postoffice box in town

and he drives there 3 or 4 times a day

looking and hoping for accepted

poems.

he thinks that poverty is a weakness of the
soul.

he thinks your mind is ill because you are
drunk all the time and have to work in a

<|endoftext|>

factory 10 or 12 hours a
night.

he brings his wife in, a beauty, stolen from a

poorer rich

man.

he lets you gaze for 30 seconds
then hustles her

out. she has been crying for some
reason.

you've got 3 or 4 days to linger in the
guesthouse he says,

"come on over to dinner

sometime. "

but he doesn't say when or

where, and then you find out that you are not even
IN HIS HOUSE.

you are in

ONE of his houses but
his house is somewhere
else-

you don't know
where.

he even has x-wives in some of his
houses.

his main concern is to keep his x-wives away from
you. he doesn't want to give up a
damn thing, and you can't blame him:
his x-wives are all young, stolen, kept,
talented, well-dressed, schooled, with
varying French-German accents.

and!: they

WRITE POETRY TOO. or

PAINT, or

fuck.

but his big problem is to get down to that mail
box in town to get back his
rejected poems

and to keep his eye on all the other mail boxes

in all his other

houses.

meanwhile, the starving Indians

sell beads and baskets in the streets of the small desert
town.

<|endoftext|>

the Indians are not allowed in his houses
not so much because they are a fuck-threat
but because they are
dirty and

ignorant, dirty? I look down at my shirt
with the beerstain on the front,
ignorant? I light a 6 cent cigar and
forget about
it.

he or they or somebody was supposed to meet me at
the

train station,
of course, they weren't

there. "We'll be there to meet the great
Poetl"

well, I looked around and didn't see any

great poet, besides it was 7 a.m. and

40 degrees, those things

happen, the trouble was there were no

bars open, nothing open, not even a

jail.

he's a poet.

he's also a doctor, a head-shrinker.
no blood involved that

way. he won't tell me whether I am crazy or

not-I don't have the

money.

he walks out with his cocktail glass
disappears for 2 hours, 3 hours,
then suddenly comes walking back in
unannounced

with the same cocktail glass
to make sure I haven't gotten hold of
something more precious than
Life itself.

my cheap green beer is killing
me. he shows heart (hurrah) and
gives me a little pill that stops my
gagging.

but nothing decent to
drink.

he'd bought a small 6 pack

for my arrival but that was gone in an

hour and 15

minutes.

<|endoftext|>

"ril buy you barrels of beer," he had
said.

I used his phone (one of his phones)

to get deliveries of beer and

cheap whisky, the town was ten miles away,

downhill. I peeled my poor dollars from my poor

roll, and the boy needed a tip, of

course.

the way it was shaping up I could see that I was

hardly Dylan Thomas yet, not even

Robert Creeley. certainly Creeley wouldn't have

had beerstains on his

shirt.

anyhow, when I finally got hold of one of his
x-wives I was too drunk to
make it.

scared too. sure, I imagined him peering
through the window-
he didn't want to give up a damn thing-
and

leveling the luger while I was
working

while "The March to the Gallows" was playing over
the Muzak

and shooting me in the ass first and

my poor brain

later.

"an intruder, " I could hear him telling them,
"ravishing one of my helpless x-wives. "

I see him published in some of the magazines
now. not very good stuff.

a poem about me
too: the Polack.

the Polack whines too much, the Polack whines about his
country, other countries, all countries, the Polack
works overtime in a factory like a fool, among other
fools with "pre-drained spirits. "
the Polack drinks seas of green beer
full of acid, the Polack has an ulcerated
hemorrhoid, the Polack picks on fags
"fragile fags." the Polack hates his
wife, hates his daughter, his daughter will become
an alcoholic, a prostitute, the Polack has an

<|endoftext|>

"obese burned out wife." the Polack has a
spastic gut. the Polack has a
"rectal brain. "

thank you, Doctor (and poet), any charge for

this? I know I still owe you for the

pill.

Your poem is not too good
but at least I got your starch up.
most of your stuff is about as lively as a
wet and deflated

beachball. but it is your round, you've won a round.

going to invite me out this

Summer? I might scrape up

trainfare. got an Indian friend who'd like to meet

you and yours, he swears he's got the biggest

pecker in the state of California.

and guess what?
he writes

On Going Back To The Street After Viewing An Art Show

they talk down through

the centuries to us,

and this we need more and more,

the statues and paintings

in midnight age

as we go along

holding dead hands.

and we would say

rather than delude the knowing:

a damn good show,

but hardly enough for a horse to eat,

and out on the sunshine street where

eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces

i decide again

that in theses centuries

they have done very well

considering the nature of their

brothers:

it's more than good
that some of them,

(closer really to the field-mouse than
falcon)

have been bold enough to try.

one thirty-six a.m.

I laugh sometimes when I think about
say

Celine at a typewriter
or Dostoevsky...
or Hamsun...

ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes,
ordinary men with hair on their heads
sitting there typing words
while having difficulties with life
while being puzzled almost to madness.

Dostoevsky gets up
he leaves the machine to piss,
comes back

drinks a glass of milk and thinks about
the casino and
the roulette wheel.

Celine stops, gets up, walks to the

window, looks out, thinks, my last patient

died today, I won't have to make any more

visits there.

when I saw him last

he paid his doctor bill;

it's those who don't pay their bills,

they live on and on.

Celine walks back, sits down at the
machine

is still for a good two minutes
then begins to type.

Hamsun stands over his machine thinking,

I wonder if they are going to believe
all these things I write?
he sits down, begins to type,
he doesn't know what a writer's block
is:

he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch
damn near as magnificent as
the sun.
he types away.

and I laugh
not out loud

but all up and down these walls, these
dirty yellow and blue walls
my white cat asleep on the
table

hiding his eyes from the
light.

he's not alone tonight

<|endoftext|>

and neither am

I.

each man must realize
that it can all disappear very

the cat, the woman, the job,

the bed, the walls, the

including love,

rest on foundations of sand -
and any given cause,
no matter how unrelated:
the death of a boy in Hong Kong
or a blizzard in Omaha ...
can serve as your undoing,
all your chinaware crashing to the
kitchen floor, your girl will enter
and you'll be standing, drunk,
in the center of it and she'll ask:
my god, what's the matter?
and you'll answer: I don't know,

I don't know ...

Raw With Love

little dark girl with
kind eyes

when it comes time to
use the knife
I won't flinch and
I won't blame
you,

as I drive along the shore alone
as the palms wave,
the ugly heavy palms,
as the living does not arrive
as the dead do not leave,

I won't blame you,
instead

I will remember the kisses
our lips raw with love
and how you gave me
everything you had
and how I

offered you what was left of
me,

and I will remember your small room

the feel of you

the light in the window

your records

your books

our morning coffee

our noons our nights

our bodies spilled together

sleeping

the tiny flowing currents
immediate and forever
your leg my leg
your arm my arm
your smile and the warmth
of you

who made me laugh
again.

little dark girl with kind eyes
you have no
knife, the knife is
mine and I won't use it
yet.

"he knows, but he thinks he can keep

Something For The Touts, The Nuns, The Grocery Clerks, And You . . .

we have everything and we have nothing
and some men do it in churches
and some men do it by tearing butterflies
in half

and some men do it in Palm Springs

laying it into butterblondes

with Cadillac souls

Cadillacs and butterflies

nothing and everything,

the face melting down to the last puff

in a cellar in Corpus Christi.

there's something for the touts, the nuns,

the grocery clerks and you . . .

something at 8 a.m., something in the library

something in the river,

everything and nothing.

in the slaughterhouse it comes running along

the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it --

one

two

three

and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead
meat, its bones against your bones
something and nothing,
it's always early enough to die and
it's always too late,

and the drill of blood in the basin white

it tells you nothing at all

and the gravediggers playing poker over

5 a.m. coffee, waiting for the grass

to dismiss the frost ...

they tell you nothing at all.

we have everything and we have nothing —
days with glass edges and the impossible stink
of river moss — worse than shit;
checkerboard days of moves and countermoves,
fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as
in victory; slow days like mules
humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed
up a road where a madman sits waiting among
bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flakey
grey.

good days too of wine and shouting, fights

in alleys, fat legs of women striving around

your bowels buried in moans,

the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering

Mother Capri, violets coming out of the ground

telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves

that robbed you.

days when children say funny and brilliant things
like savages trying to send you a message through

<|endoftext|>

their bodies while their bodies are still
alive enough to transmit and feel and run up
and down without locks and paychecks and
ideals and possessions and beetle-like
opinions.

days when you can cry all day long in
a green room with the door locked, days
when you can laugh at the breadman
because his legs are too long, days
of looking at hedges . . .

and nothing, and nothing, the days of
the bosses, yellow men
with bad breath and big feet, men
who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk
as if melody had never been invented, men
who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and
profit, men with expensive wives they possess
like 60 acres of ground to be drilled
or shown-off or to be walled away from
the incompetent, men who'd kill you
because they're crazy and justify it because
it's the law, men who stand in front of
windows 30 feet wide and see nothing,
men with luxury yachts who can sail around
the world and yet never get out of their vest
Dockets, men like snails, men like eels, men
ike slugs, and not as good . . .
and nothing, getting your last paycheck
at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an
aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a
barbershop, at a job you didn't want
anyway.

income tax, sickness, servility, broken
arms, broken heads -- all the stuffing
come out like an old pillow.

we have everything and we have nothing,
some do it well enough for a while and
then give way. fame gets them or disgust
or age or lack of proper diet or ink
across the eyes or children in college
or new cars or broken backs while skiing
in Switzerland or new politics or new wives
or just natural change and decay --
the man you knew yesterday hooking
for ten rounds or drinking for three days and
three nights by the Sawtooth mountains now
just something under a sheet or a cross
or a stone or under an easy delusion,
or packing a bible or a golf bag or a
briefcase: how they go, how they go! — all

<|endoftext|>

the ones you thought would never go.

days like this, like your day today,
maybe the rain on the window trying to
get through to you. what do you see today?
what is it? where are you? the best
days are sometimes the first, sometimes
the middle and even sometimes the last,
the vacant lots are not bad, churches in
Europe on postcards are not bad. people in
wax museums frozen into their best sterility
are not bad, horrible but not bad. the
cannon, think of the cannon, and toast for
breakfast the coffee hot enough you
know your tongue is still there, three
geraniums outside a window, trying to be
red and trying to be pink and trying to be
geraniums, no wonder sometimes the women
cry, no wonder the mules don't want
to go up the hill, are you in a hotel room
in Detroit looking for a cigarette? one more
good day. a little bit of it. and as
the nurses come out of the building after
their shift, having had enough, eight nurses
with different names and different places
to go -- walking across the lawn, some of them
want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a
hot bath, some of them want a man, some
of them are hardly thinking at all. enough
and not enough, arcs and pilgrims, oranges
gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of
tissue paper.

in the most decent sometimes sun
there is the softsmoke feeling from urns
and the canned sound of old battleplanes
and if you go inside and run your finger
along the window ledge you'll find
dirt, maybe even earth,
and if you look out the window
there will be the day, and as you
get older you'll keep looking
keep looking

sucking your tongue in a little
ah ah no no maybe

some do it naturally
some obscenely
everywhere.

waving winebottles

with a photograph of M. Monroe.

there is a loneliness in this world so great
that you can see it in the slow movement of
the hands of a clock

people so tired
mutilated

either by love or no love.

people just are not good to each other
one on one.

the rich are not good to the rich
the poor are not good to the poor.

we are afraid.

our educational system tells us
that we can all be
big-ass winners

it hasn't told us
about the gutters
or the suicides.

or the terror of one person
aching in one place
alone

untouched
unspoken to

watering a plant.

people are not good to each other,
people are not good to each other,
people are not good to each other.

I suppose they never will be.

I don't ask them to be.

but sometimes I think about
it.

the beads will swing

the clouds will cloud

and the killer will behead the child

like taking a bite out of an ice cream cone.

too much
too little

too fat
too thin
or nobody

more haters than lovers.

people are not good to each other.

perhaps if they were

our deaths would not be so sad.

meanwhile I look at young girls
stems

flowers of chance,
there must be a way.

surely there must be a way that we have not yet
though of.

it demands

it says that there is a chance,

The Genius Of The Crowd

there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average
human being to supply any given army on any given day

and the best at murder are those who preach against it

and the best at hate are those who preach love

and the best at war finally are those who preach peace

those who preach god, need god

those who preach peace do not have peace

those who preach peace do not have love

beware the preachers
beware the knowers

beware those who are always reading books
beware those who either detest poverty
or are proud of it
beware those quick to praise
for they need praise in return
beware those who are quick to censor
they are afraid of what they do not know
beware those who seek constant crowds for
they are nothing alone

beware the average man the average woman
beware their love, their love is average
seeks average

but there is genius in their hatred

there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you

to kill anybody

not wanting solitude

not understanding solitude

they will attempt to destroy anything

that differs from their own

not being able to create art

they will not understand art

they will consider their failure as creators

only as a failure of the world

not being able to love fully

they will believe your love incomplete

and then they will hate you

and their hatred will be perfect

like a shining diamond
like a knife
like a mountain
like a tiger
like hemlock

their finest art

the German hotel

the German hotel was very strange and expensive and had
double doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over-
looked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings
it was usually too late for breakfast and the maids
would be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in
towels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the
maids and the desk man and the day desk man was all
right because we were sober during the day but we had
trouble with the night man who was some sort of snob
and not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice
and wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to
say the other guests objected to our noise,
what other guests?

I always told him that everything was very quiet,

nothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so

will you please stop ringing?

but he kept ringing, he became almost like a

companion to us through the night.

but the day man was very nice, he always had little

messages of importance that either meant money, or a

good friend coming to see us, or both.

we stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to

Europe and each time we checked out the day clerk

bowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed

and pleasant and he said each time: "it was nice to

have you with us. please come here again if you return."

"thank you," we said, "thank you."

it's our favorite hotel and if I ever get rich I am
going to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will
be enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody.

the great slob

I was always a natural slob
I liked to lay upon the bed
in undershirt (stained, of
course) (and with cigarette
holes)
shoes off
beerbottle in hand
trying to shake off a
difficult night, say with a
woman still around
walking the floor
complaining about this and
that,

and I'd work up a
belch and say, "HEY, YOU DON'T
LIKE IT? THEN GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF HERE!”

I really loved myself, I
really loved my slob-
self, and

they seemed to also:

always leaving

but almost

always

coming

back.

The History Of One Tough Motherfucker

he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and
terrorized

a white cross-eyed tailless cat

I took him in and fed him and he stayed

grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway

and ran him over

I took what was left to a vet who said, " not much
chance. ..give him these pills. ..his backbone
is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow
mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at
these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets

The House

They are building a house

half a block down

and I sit up here

with the shades down

listening to the sounds,

the hammers pounding in nails,

thack thack thack thack,

and then I hear birds,

and thack thack thack,

and I go to bed,

I pull the covers to my throat;
they have been building this house
for a month, and soon it will have
its people. ..sleeping, eating,
loving, moving around,
but somehow
now

it is not right,
there seems a madness,
men walk on top with nails
in their mouths

and I read about Castro and Cuba,

and at night I walk by

and the ribs of the house show

and inside I can see cats walking

the way cats walk,

and then a boy rides by on a bicycle

and still the house is not done

and in the morning the men

will be back

walking around on the house
with their hammers,

and it seems people should not build houses
anymore,

it seems people should not get married
anymore,

it seems people should stop working
and sit in small rooms
on 2nd floors

under electric lights without shades;

it seems there is a lot to forget

and a lot not to do,

and in drugstores, markets, bars,

the people are tired, they do not want

to move, and I stand there at night

and look through this house and the

house does not want to be built;

through its sides I can see the purple hills

and the first lights of evening,

and it is cold

and I button my coat

and I stand there looking through the house

<|endoftext|>

and the cats stop and look at me

until I am embarrased

and move North up the sidewalk

where I will buy

cigarettes and beer

and return to my room.

The Icecream People

the lady has me temporarily off the bottle

and now the pecker stands up

better.

however, things change overnight—
instead of listening to Shostakovich and
Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke
the nights change, new
complexities:

we drive to Baskin-Robbins,

31 flavors:

Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry
Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint...

we park outside and look at icecream
people

a very healthy and satisfied people,
nary a potential suicide in sight
(they probably even vote)
and I tell her

"what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they
find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?"
"come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in
and stand with the icecream people,
none of them are cursing or threatening
the clerks.

there seem to be no hangovers or
grievances.

I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave
that flows about. I feel like a leper in a
beauty contest, we finally get our sundaes and
sit in the car and eat them.

I must admit they are quite good, a curious new
world, (all my friends tell me I am looking
better, "you're looking good, man, we thought you
were going to die there for a while...")

—those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the
hospitals...

and later that night

there is use for the pecker, use for

love, and it is glorious,

long and true,

and afterwards we speak of easy things;
our heads by the open window with the moonlight
looking through, we sleep in each other's
arms.

the icecream people make me feel good,
inside and out.

the lucky ones

stuck in the rain on the freeway, 6:15 p.m.,
these are the lucky ones, these are the
dutifully employed, most with their radios on as loud
as possible as they try not to think or remember.

this is our new civilization: as men
once lived in trees and caves now they live
in their automobiles and on freeways as

the local news is heard again and again while
we shift from first gear to second and back to first.

there's a poor fellow stalled in the fast lane ahead, hood
up, he's standing against the freeway fence
a newspaper over his head in the rain.

the other cars force their way around his car, pull out into
the next lane in front of cars determined to shut them off.

in the lane to my right a driver is being followed by a
police car with blinking red and blue lights - he surely
can't be <i>speeding</i> as

suddenly the rain comes down in a giant wash and all the
cars stop and

even with the windows up I can smell somebody's clutch
burning.

I just hope it's not mine as

the wall of water diminishes and we go back into first
gear; we are all still
a long way from home as I memorize

the silhouette of the car in front of me and the shape of the

driver's head or
what

I can see of it above the headrest while

his bumper sticker asks me

HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR KID TODAY?

suddenly I have an urge to scream

as another wall of water comes down and the

man on the radio announces that there will be a 70 percent

chance of showers tomorrow night

and the sun weilds mercy
but like a jet torch carried to high,
and the jets whip across its sight
and rockets leap like toads,
and the boys get out the maps
and pin-cuishon the moon,
old green cheese,

no life there but too much on earth:

our unwashed India boys

crosssing their legs, playing pipes,

starving with sucked in bellies,

watching the snakes volute

like beautiful women in the hungry air;

the rockets leap,

the rockets leap like hares,

clearing clump and dog

replacing out-dated bullets;

the Chineses still carve

in jade, quietly stuffing rice

into their hunger, a hunger

a thousand years old,

their muddy rivers moving with fire

and song, barges, houseboats

pushed by drifting poles

of waiting without wanting;

in Turkey they face the East

on their carpets

praying to a purple god

who smokes and laughs

and sticks fingers in their eyes

blinding them, as gods will do;

but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer,

for some reason, precious;

madness drifts like lily pads

on a pond circling senselessly;

the painters paint dipping

their reds and greens and yellows,

poets rhyme their lonliness,

musicians starve as always

and the novelists miss the mark,

but not the pelican , the gull;

pelicans dip and dive, rise,

shaking shocked half-dead

radioactive fish from their beaks;

of helmet, instrument and glass;
a lightning crashes across
the window and in a million rooms
lovers lie entwined and lost
and sick as peace;

flowers open as they always have
opened but covered with thin dust
of rocket fuel and mushrooms,
poison mushrooms; it's a bad time,
a dog-sick time-curtain
act 3, standing room only,

SOLD OUT, SOLD OUT, SOLD OUT again,

by god, by somebody and something,

by rockets and generals and

leaders, by poets , doctors, comedians,

by manufacturers of soup

and biscuits, Janus-faced hucksters

of their own indexerity;

I can now see now the coal-slick
contanminated fields, a snail or 2,
bile, obsidian, a fish or 3
in the shallows, an obloquy of our

these things that we support most well

have nothing to do with up,

and we do with them

out of boredom or fear or money

or cracked intelligence;

our circle and our candle of light

we heave out with Idea

and lose the Center:

all wax without the wick,

and we see names that once meant

wisdom,

Three Oranges

first time my father overheard me listening to
this bit of music he asked me,

"what is it?"

"it's called Love For Three Oranges, "

I informed him.

"boy," he said, "that's getting it
cheap. "
he meant sex.
listening to it

I always imagined three oranges
sitting there,

you know how orange they can
get,

so mightily orange,
maybe Prokofiev had meant
what my father
thought.

if so, I preferred it the
other way

the most horrible thing
I could think of
was part of me being
what ejaculated out of the
end of his
stupid penis.

I will never forgive him
for that,

his trick that I am stuck
with,

I find no nobility in
parenthood.

I say kill the Father

To The Whore Who Took My Poems

some say we should keep personal remorse from the
poem,

stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,
but jezus;

twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons and you have
my

paintings too, my best ones; its stifling:

are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?

why didn't you take my money? they usually do

from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.

next time take my left arm or a fifty

but not my poems:

I'm not Shakespeare
but sometime simply

there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;
there'll always be mony and whores and drunkards
down to the last bomb,
but as God said,
crossing his legs,

I see where I have made plenty of poets

but not so very much

poetry.

they found him walking along the freeway

all red in

front

he had taken a rusty tin can

and cut off his sexual

machinery

as if to say —

see what you've done to

me? you might as well have the

rest.

and he put part of him
in one pocket and
part of him in
another

and that's how they found him,

walking

along.

they gave him over to the
doctors

who tried to sew the parts

back

on

but the parts were
quite contented
the way they
were.

I think sometimes of all of the good
ass

turned over to the
monsters of the
world.

maybe it was his protest against

this or

his protest

against

everything.

Young in New Orleans

starving there, sitting around the bars,
and at night walking the streets for
hours,

the moonlight always seemed fake
to me, maybe it was,
and in the French Quarter I watched
the horses and buggies going by,
everybody sitting high in the open
carriages, the black driver, and in
back the man and the woman,
usually young and always white,
and I was always white,
and hardly charmed by the
world.

New Orleans was a place to
hide.

I could piss away my life,

unmolested.

except for the rats.

the rats in my dark small room

very much resented sharing it

with me.

they were large and fearless
and stared at me with eyes
that spoke
an unblinking
death.

women were beyond me.
they saw something
depraved.

there was one waitress
a little older than
I, she rather smiled,
lingered when she
brought my
coffee.

that was plenty for
me, that was
enough.

there was something about

that city, though

it didn't let me feel guilty

that I had no feeling for the

things so many others

needed.

it let me alone.

sitting up in my bed
the Mights out,

<|endoftext|>

hearing the outside
sounds,

lifting my cheap
bottle of wine,
letting the warmth of
the grape
enter
me

as I heard the rats
moving about the
room,

I preferred them
to

humans.

being lost,
being crazy maybe
is not so bad
if you can be
that way
undisturbed.

New Orleans gave me
that.

nobody ever called
my name.

no telephone,
no car,
no job,
no

anything.

me and the
rats

and my youth,
one time,
that time
I knew

even through the

nothingness,

it was a

celebration

of something not to

do

but only
know.
