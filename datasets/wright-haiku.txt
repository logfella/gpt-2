I am nobody:
A red sinking autumn sun
Took my name away.

<|endoftext|>

For you, O gulls,
I order slaty waters
And this leaden sky!

<|endoftext|>

Keep straight down this block,
Then turn right where you will find
A peach tree blooming.

<|endoftext|>

Sweep away the clouds
And let a dome of blue sky
Give this sea a name!

<|endoftext|>

I give permission
For this slow spring rain to
soak The violet beds.

<|endoftext|>

Follow wherever
The tree branches make arches
In the torrid sun.

<|endoftext|>

Make up your mind, Snail!
You are half inside your house,
And halfway out!

<|endoftext|>

O finicky cat,
Forgive me for this spring rain
That disgusts you so!

<|endoftext|>

Steep with deep sweetness,
O You White Magnolias,
This still torpid night!

<|endoftext|>

“Shut up, you crickets!
How can I hear what my wife
Is saying to me?”

<|endoftext|>

You moths must leave now;
I am turning out the light
And going to sleep.

<|endoftext|>

“Oh, Mr. Scarecrow,
Stop waving your arms about
Like a foreigner!”

<|endoftext|>

I would like a bell
Tolling in this soft twilight
Over willow trees.

<|endoftext|>

I grant to sparrows
The telegraph wires that brought
Me such good tidings!

<|endoftext|>

O Anvil, be beaten,
Bear all the bitter blows till
The spring sun goes down!

<|endoftext|>

All right, You Sparrows;
The sun has set and you can now
Stop your chattering!

<|endoftext|>

In a misty rain
A butterfly is riding
The tail of a cow.

<|endoftext|>

Sparrow’s excrement
Becomes quickly powdery
On sizzling pavements.

<|endoftext|>

A summer barnyard:
Swishing tails of twenty cows
Twitching at the flies.

<|endoftext|>

The dog’s violent sneeze
Fails to rouse a single fly
On his mangy back.

<|endoftext|>

On winter mornings
The candle shows faint markings
Of the teeth of rats.

<|endoftext|>

With a twitching nose
A dog reads a telegram
On a wet tree trunk.

<|endoftext|>

On muddy puddles
Of the hoof-tramped farmyard,
Flashing glints of spring.

<|endoftext|>

The webs of spiders
Sticking to my sweaty face
In the dusty woods.

<|endoftext|>

A horse is pissing
In the snow-covered courtyard
In the morning sun.

<|endoftext|>

From a red tile roof
A cat is licking beads of dew
In a humid dawn.

<|endoftext|>

Across the river
Huge dark sheets of cool spring rain
Falling on a town.

<|endoftext|>

In the summer haze:
Behind magnolias,
Faint sheets of lightning.

<|endoftext|>

A huge drift of snow
Blocks the narrow pathway to
The little toy shop.

<|endoftext|>

A bloody knife blade
Is being licked by a cat
At hog-killing time.

<|endoftext|>

In the falling snow
A laughing boy holds out his palms
Until they are white.

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of light
In this lofty autumn sky
To turn the lake black.

Just enough of snow
For a boy’s finger to write
His name on the porch.

<|endoftext|>

The sound of the rain, 
Blotted out now and then
By a sticky cough.

<|endoftext|>

Venturing outdoors,
The children walk timidly,
Respecting the snow.

<|endoftext|>

A brick tenement
Is receiving furniture
In a light snowfall.

<|endoftext|>

Past the window pane
A solitary snowflake
Spins furiously.

<|endoftext|>

That abandoned house,
With its yard of fallen leaves,
In the setting sun.

<|endoftext|>

A soft wind at dawn
Lifts one dry leaf and lays it
Upon another.

<|endoftext|>

In gray winter light,
Dead flies fill the window sill
Of a musty room.

Just before dawn,
When the streets are deserted,
A light spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

Seen from a hilltop,
Shadowy in winter rain,
A man and his mule.

<|endoftext|>

What river is that
Meandering through the mist
In fields of young corn?

<|endoftext|>

A man leaves his house
And walks around his winter fields
And then goes back in.

<|endoftext|>

As though for always,
Each petal lit by the sun,
— Apple blossoms!

<|endoftext|>

A spring mountain holds
The foundations of a house

Long since tumbled down.

<|endoftext|>

The spring lingers on
In the scent of a damp log
Rotting in the sun.

<|endoftext|>

A bursting ripe plum
Forms a pool upon a leaf

From which sparrows drink.

<|endoftext|>

Burning autumn leaves,
I yearn to make the bonfire
Bigger and bigger.

<|endoftext|>

One magnolia
Landed upon another

In the dew-wet grass.

<|endoftext|>

As the sun goes down,
A green melon splits open
And juice trickles out.

<|endoftext|>

Gazing at her face
Reflected in the spring pond,
The girl grimaces.

<|endoftext|>

A sparrow’s feather
On a barb of rusty wire
In the sizzling heat.

<|endoftext|>

A September rain
Tumbling down in drops so big
They wobble as they fall.

<|endoftext|>

Shaking the water
Off his dripping body,
The dog swims again.

<|endoftext|>

The cool green melon
Made me trace my forefinger
Along its whole length.

Sleety rain at night
Seasoning swelling turnips
With a tangy taste.

<|endoftext|>

Heaps of black cherries
Glittering with drops of rain
In the evening sun.

<|endoftext|>

Gusty autumn rain
Swinging a yellow lantern
Over wet cattle.

<|endoftext|>

Sun is glinting on
A washerwoman’s black arms
In cold creek water.

<|endoftext|>

The melting snowflakes
Are wetting the brown horse’s back
Darker than his flanks.

<|endoftext|>

A lance of spring sun
Falls upon the moldy oats
In a musty barn.

<|endoftext|>

From far, far off,
From over the leaden sea,
The call of a ship.

<|endoftext|>

The harbor at dawn:
The faint scent of oranges
On gusts of March wind.

<|endoftext|>

A December wind
Swept the sky clean of clouds
And froze the lake still.

<|endoftext|>

A freezing night wind
Wafts the scent of frying fish
From the waterfront.

<|endoftext|>

The day is so long
That even noisy sparrows
Fall strangely silent.

<|endoftext|>

A chillSpanish dawn:
Vapor from the blood of a
Freshly slaughtered bull.

<|endoftext|>

Whose town did you leave,
O wild and droning spring rain,
And where do you go?

<|endoftext|>

At the water’s edge,
Amid drifting brown leaves,
A dead bloated fish.

<|endoftext|>

It is not the sun,
But the spring rain that beats loose
The rose’s petals.

<|endoftext|>

Droning into the room,
The wasp circles angrily,
Then hums slowly out.

<|endoftext|>

Naked to the sky,
A village without a name
In the setting sun.

<|endoftext|>

Midnight is striking:
In a cold drizzle of rain
Two men are parting.

<|endoftext|>

Spring begins shyly
With one hairpin of green grass
In a flower pot.

<|endoftext|>

The path in the woods
Is barred by spider webs
Beaded with spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

Dewdrop joins dewdrop
Till a petal holds a pool
Reflecting its rose.

<|endoftext|>

An apple blossom
Trembling on a sunlit branch
From the weight of bees.

<|endoftext|>

Spring arrives stealthily:
Scaly flecks of peeling paint
On a whitewashed wall.

<|endoftext|>

After the rainstorm,
A tendril of Wisteria
Peeps over the wall.

<|endoftext|>

The river ripples
From the caressing shadows
Of a willow tree.

<|endoftext|>

A butterfly makes
The sunshine even brighter
With fluttering wings.

<|endoftext|>

A falling petal
Strikes one floating on a pond,
And they both sink.

<|endoftext|>

On the pond’s green scum
A yellow butterfly lights;
And then there are two.

<|endoftext|>

Upon a pine tree,
A snail slides out of its shell
To witness the spring.

<|endoftext|>

The wings of a bee,
Tarnishing the smooth whiteness
Of a magnolia.

<|endoftext|>

Meticulously,
The cat licks dew-wet cobwebs
From between his toes.

<|endoftext|>

The cat’s shining eyes
Are remarkably blue
Beside the jonquils.

<|endoftext|>

In the hot kitchen
A feather drags its shadow
Over steaming rice.

<|endoftext|>

How the rain washes
Wrinkled skins of writhing worms
To a tender pink!

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of wind
To agitate soundlessly
The maple tree leaves.

<|endoftext|>

A caterpillar
Has entrapped wet spider webs
Upon its short hairs.

<|endoftext|>

Leaving its nest,
The sparrow sinks a second,
Then opens its wings.

<|endoftext|>

A snail hesitates,
Contracting one of its horns
In a gust of wind.

<|endoftext|>

Like a fishhook,
The sunflower’s long shadow
Hovers in the lake.

<|endoftext|>

You could see warm wind
Drying wet wisps of her hair
About her forehead.

<|endoftext|>

In the setting sun,
Each tree bud is clinging fast
To drying raindrops.

<|endoftext|>

It took five seconds
For the barefoot boy’s wet tracks
To dry on the porch.

<|endoftext|>

Where the tree’s shadow
Lingers on the macadam,
Traces of spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of rain
To set black ants a-swimming
Over yellow sand.

<|endoftext|>

Quickly vanishing,
The first drops of summer rain
On an old wood door.

<|endoftext|>

On the pond’s bottom
The faint shadow of a fish
Flitting on white sand.

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of rain
To bring the smell of silk
From umbrellas.

<|endoftext|>

Trembling on the wall,
A yellow water shadow
From the lake outside.

<|endoftext|>

A cow chews her cud
As flimsy heaps of snowflakes
Sift from off her horns.

<|endoftext|>

Beads of quicksilver
On a black umbrella: Moonlit
April rain.

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of snow
To make the back of each cow
Vivid in the dusk.

<|endoftext|>

From the scarecrow’s sleeve
A tiny green leaf unfolds
On an oaken arm.

<|endoftext|>

On a pulpy log,
An ant pauses in the sun
And waves its feelers.

<|endoftext|>

I laid down my book:
A tendril of
Wisteria
Encircling my leg.

Ill

With shy yellow smiles,
Baby pumpkins are hiding
Under yellow leaves.

<|endoftext|>

And though level full,
The petal holds its dew,
And without trembling.

<|endoftext|>

A twisting tendril
Tilting off into sunshine,
Winding on itself.

<|endoftext|>

Not even the sun
Can make oak tree leaves as green
As the starlight does.

<|endoftext|>

Why do I listen
To the muttering thunder
This night of spring?

<|endoftext|>

A lone lance of sun
Spotlighting a lone fly
Washing one blue wing.

<|endoftext|>

The crow flew so fast
That he left his lonely caw
Behind in the fields.

<|endoftext|>

For some strange reason
Sparrows are congregating
In an old rose bush.

<|endoftext|>

On a clapboard house,
An old oak tree’s shadow fades
In the spring sunset.

<|endoftext|>

Crying and crying,
Melodious strings of geese
Passing a graveyard.

<|endoftext|>

The consumptive man,
Who lives in the room next door,
Did not cough today.

<|endoftext|>

And what do you think,
O still and awesome spider,
Of this summer rain?

<|endoftext|>

And now this thing too:
A drunken girl vomiting
In the autumn rain.

<|endoftext|>

Persistent magpies
Are pecking amid hot grasses
At one blue glass eye.

<|endoftext|>

Yellow petals gone,
The sunflower looks blankly
In a drizzling rain.

<|endoftext|>

Yet another dawn
Upon yellowing leaves
And my sleepless eyes.

<|endoftext|>

Why does the blindman
Stop so still for a second
In the drizzling dusk?

<|endoftext|>

This autumn drizzle
Is our bond with other eyes
That can see no more.

<|endoftext|>

This winding dirt path
Ends in a tangle of thorns,
In the autumn mist.

<|endoftext|>

A long autumn day:
A wind blowing from the west,
But none from the east.

<|endoftext|>

Is this the dirt road,
Winding through windy trees,
That I must travel?

<|endoftext|>

What stranger is that
Walking in the winter rain
And looking this way?

<|endoftext|>

Is there some design
In these deep random raindrops
Drying in the dust?

<|endoftext|>

One autumn evening
A stranger enters a village
And passes on through.

<|endoftext|>

Six cows are grazing;
The seventh stands near a fence,
Staring into space.

<|endoftext|>

That road is empty,
The one leading into hills
In autumn twilight.

<|endoftext|>

A pregnant black rat
Poking in a paper bag
In a purple dawn.

<|endoftext|>

Upon the roofs edge,
A cat in autumn moonlight
Contemplates the road.

<|endoftext|>

Pulling him ahead,
The blindman’s dog takes a path
Between summer graves.

<|endoftext|>

A spring pond as calm
As the lips of the dead girl
Under its water.

<|endoftext|>

An autumn sunset:
A buzzard sails slowly past,
Not flapping its wings.

<|endoftext|>

A wounded sparrow
Sinks in clear cold lake water,
Its eyes still open.

<|endoftext|>

Why is hail so wild,
Bouncing so frighteningly,
Only to lie so still?

<|endoftext|>

Amidst the flowers
A China clock is ticking
In the dead man’s room.

<|endoftext|>

A bright glowing moon
Pouring out its radiance
Upon tall tombstones.

<|endoftext|>

In a silent room
A feather rises slowly
And floats in the heat.

<|endoftext|>

It is without taste,
Or am I a stranger here—?
These drops of spring dew.

<|endoftext|>

As still as death is,
Under a circling buzzard,
An autumn village.

<|endoftext|>

I had long felt that
Those sprawling black railroad tracks
Would bring down this snow.

<|endoftext|>

Late one winter night
I saw a skinny scarecrow
Gobbling slabs of meat.

<|endoftext|>

The harvest is in:
The trees on the distant hills
Have been bought by clouds.

<|endoftext|>

After seven days,
The corpse in the coffin
Turned on its side.

<|endoftext|>

The snow has melted,
And now all the fields belong
To the railroad tracks.

<|endoftext|>

Standing in spring rain,
The hitchhiker has a stance
That nobody trusts.

<|endoftext|>

Empty railroad tracks:
A train sounds in the spring hills
And the rails leap with life.

<|endoftext|>

A winter evening:
The black craggy mountains
Are calling down rain.

<|endoftext|>

The drumming of sleet
Against the roof and windows
Brightly fans the fire.

<|endoftext|>

A train crashes past:
A butterfly still as stone
On the humid earth.

<|endoftext|>

In the melting snow
That is tracked into the house
Is one green grass blade.

<|endoftext|>

The barking of dogs
Is deepening the yellow
Of the sunflowers.

<|endoftext|>

The call of a bird
Sends a solid cake of snow
Sliding off a roof.

<|endoftext|>

Deep green melons
Anchoring gigantic clouds,
Dyeing them purple.

<|endoftext|>

As the music stops,
Flooding strongly to the ear,
The sound of spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

I slept so long and sound,
But I did not know why until
I saw the snow outside.

<|endoftext|>

The caw of a crow,
Telling of a taut white sail
On the flashing river.

<|endoftext|>

The snow on the bank
Stains the river water black
Under a blue sky.

<|endoftext|>

Bulging yellow clouds:
Between peals of spring thunder,
Deep white silences.

<|endoftext|>

Beyond a railroad,
A river and a sunset
In the April rain.

Turning on the light
The drip-drip of the spring rain
Lessens in the dawn.

<|endoftext|>

A spring haze wipes out
The brick wall between my house
And the hillside graves.

<|endoftext|>

With indignation
A little girl spanks her doll,—
The sound of spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

The scarecrow’s old hat
Was flung by the winter wind
Into a graveyard.

The first day of spring:
The snow on the far mountains,
Brighter than ever.

<|endoftext|>

Merciful autumn
Tones down the shabby curtains
Of my rented room.

<|endoftext|>

Coming from the woods,
A bull has a lilac sprig
Dangling from a horn.

<|endoftext|>

Winter rain at night
Sweetening the taste of bread
And spicing the soup.

<|endoftext|>

Spring dawn is glinting
On a dew-wet garbage can
In a city street.

<|endoftext|>

From an icy quay:
When her ship heaves into sight,
The sea disappears.

<|endoftext|>

The summer moonlight
Gleams upon a blacksmith’s forge,
And cools red embers.

<|endoftext|>

The elevator
Lifts him up twenty stories,—
A bright summer sea!

<|endoftext|>

When the train had stopped,
A coffin was unloaded
Amid steam and smoke.

<|endoftext|>

A bright window pane
With one slowly crawling fly
Against a still cloud.

<|endoftext|>

All the city’s bells
Clang deafeningly this midnight,
Frightening the New Year!

<|endoftext|>

No birds are flying;
The tree leaves are still as stone,—
An autumn evening.

<|endoftext|>

The sound of the wind
Is shaping long drifts of snow
On a mountain ridge.

<|endoftext|>

From these warm spring days,
I can still see her sad face
In its last autumn.

<|endoftext|>

In an old woodshed
The long points of icicles
Are sharpening the wind.

<|endoftext|>

The night must be long
For even a yellow moon
Over fields of snow.

<|endoftext|>

A blacksmith’s hammer
Beating the silver moon thin
On a cool spring night.

<|endoftext|>

The first day of spring:
A servant’s hips shake as she
Wipes a mirror clean.

<|endoftext|>

The shuddering flank
Of a bull in the spring rain
Calls down the thunder.

<|endoftext|>

A silent spring wood:
A crow opens its sharp beak
And creates a sky.

<|endoftext|>

Over spring mountains
A star ends the paragraph
Of a thunderstorm.

<|endoftext|>

A cock’s shrill crow
Is driving the spring dawn stars
From out of the sky.

<|endoftext|>

Did somebody call?
Looking over my shoulder:
Massive spring mountains.

<|endoftext|>

To see the spring sky,
A doll in a store window
Leans far to one side.

<|endoftext|>

As my delegate,
With joints stiff with winter cold,
The first ant of spring.

<|endoftext|>

As the spring snow melts,
All the village houses are
Huddling together.

<|endoftext|>

The shouts of children
Billowing window curtains
On spring’s first day.

<|endoftext|>

A horse gives a neigh
And shakes down the first spring rain
With his tossing mane.

<|endoftext|>

As my delegate,
The spring wind has its fingers
In a young girl’s hair.

<|endoftext|>

The sprinting spring rain
Knocks upon a wooden door
That has just been shut.

<|endoftext|>

A fleeing white fence
Is ripping the moon away
From the April clouds.

<|endoftext|>

From the skyscraper,
All the bustling streets converge
Towards a spring sea.

<|endoftext|>

Fields of young barley
Under ten billion hailstones
In the
April sun.

<|endoftext|>

While plowing the earth,
All my crows are visiting
A neighboring farm.

<|endoftext|>

Legions of crows
Are busily unplanting
The farmer’s barley.

<|endoftext|>

The trilling sparrows
Sound as if they too had got
A letter today!

<|endoftext|>

Surely that spring moon,
So yellow and so fragile,
Will crack on a cloud!

<|endoftext|>

A far-away fog
Is troubling the evening star
Above a spring hill.

<|endoftext|>

Enough of dawn light
To show pearly pear blossom
Burning from within.

<|endoftext|>

The cathedral bell
Is now rocking the spring moon
Upon the river.

Even the horse looks
At the duck and her ducklings
Following in line.

<|endoftext|>

Holding too much rain,
The tulip stoops and spills it,
Then straightens again.

<|endoftext|>

A highway of black ants
Diagonally bisecting
A sun-hot white wall.

<|endoftext|>

While convalescing,
The red roses have no smell,
Gently mocking me.

<|endoftext|>

Every sandgrain
Of the vast sunlit desert
Hears the snake crawling.

<|endoftext|>

Like a spreading fire,
Blossoms leap from tree to tree
In a blazing spring.

<|endoftext|>

In the damp darkness,
Croaking frogs are belching out
The scent of magnolias.

<|endoftext|>

The sudden thunder
Startles the magnolias
To a deeper white.

Fierce sunflowers
Have forced every cloud fleece
Out of the hot sky.

<|endoftext|>

A lone cricket’s cry
Slices a sliver of moon
And scatters the stars.

<|endoftext|>

At the dying sun,
Glaring with greedy black eyes,
Tiger-lilies.

<|endoftext|>

A descending moon
Commanding crickets to sing
Louder in the woods.

<|endoftext|>

The magnolias
Waft their misty scent skywards,
Obscuring the moon.

<|endoftext|>

O black rattlesnake,
Why in all hell did you choose
This path to sleep in?

<|endoftext|>

The caw of a crow
Draws a diagonal line
Across a field of corn.

<|endoftext|>

The dusty petals
Of ferocious sunflowers
Hold the rain at bay.

The caw of a crow
Loops over a sunburnt hill
And fills a valley.

<|endoftext|>

The crows are boasting
Of having driven the sun
Down a murky sky.

<|endoftext|>

Sitting in the park,
Hearing the sound of an axe
Rippling the lake.

<|endoftext|>

In a red sunset
A frog commands the night wind
To roll out a moon.

A blindman’s eyebrows
Condensing the autumn fog
Into beads of light.

<|endoftext|>

The darting fire-flies
Are dragging the river along
To where the sun went down.

<|endoftext|>

Leaving the doctor,
The whole world looks different
This autumn morning.

<|endoftext|>

As day tumbles down,
The setting sun’s signature
Is written in red.

<|endoftext|>

Harvesting over, 
The empty fields are yearning
Toward a gray sky.

<|endoftext|>

In a murky dawn
The faint moon is sucking smoke
Out of chimneytops.

<|endoftext|>

The wheat has been cut,
And now a blue-gray mountain
Is haunting the lake.

<|endoftext|>

Harvesting over,
The empty fields have been bought
By the horizon.

<|endoftext|>

The sleet stops droning
And the still silence forbids
Even the sun to shine.

<|endoftext|>

Even toy soldiers
Perspire with weariness
In the autumn mist.

<|endoftext|>

A rooster’s sharp crow
Punctures a gray dawn sky,
Letting out spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

Fiery apples
Are searing the tree leaves
And singeing the grass.

<|endoftext|>

From a tenement,
The blue jazz of a trumpet
Weaving autumn mists.

<|endoftext|>

I almost forgot
To hang up an autumn moon
Over the mountain.

<|endoftext|>

The shore slips away
From the melancholy ship
In an autumn mist.

<|endoftext|>

Crying of the past,
Cascading upon my roof,
A cold winter rain.

<|endoftext|>

A wisp of white smoke:
Out of a widow’s chimney
Winter is rising.

<|endoftext|>

A dog’s blood-red bark
Lights up the summer forest
And blanches the moon.

<|endoftext|>

Sounds of red and black:
Rain beating upon the river
And upon tree leaves.

<|endoftext|>

The shimmering heat
Undulates the drooping flag
Atop the courthouse.

<|endoftext|>

A night of spring stars:
Waves breaking beyond the wall
Have a dark blue sound.

<|endoftext|>

After the parade,
After all the flags are gone,
The snow is whiter.

<|endoftext|>

A departing ship
Sends forth a deep-throated tone
That turns the sea blue.

<|endoftext|>

Even the cat smiles
When the hen swallows water
With back-tilted head.

<|endoftext|>

The blue of this sky
Sounds so loud that it can be heard
Only with our eyes.

<|endoftext|>

The wings of crows
Are scudding the purple clouds
And misting the fields.

<|endoftext|>

The cock’s ready crow
Is as dark as autumn dawn
With edges of white.

<|endoftext|>

No star and no moon:
A dog is barking whitely
In the winter night.

<|endoftext|>

The swaying lanterns
Under the magnolias
Glow with sweet scent.

<|endoftext|>

Lifting the lantern,
The scent of plums on the tree
Became more fragrant.

<|endoftext|>

The sharper the scent
Of magnolia blossoms,
The hotter the sun.

<|endoftext|>

They smelt like roses; 
But when I put on the light,
They were violets.

<|endoftext|>

One, two, three June bugs;
Now there are seven June bugs
More of torrid heat.

<|endoftext|>

The valley is full
Of the scent of violets
Scattered by spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

The smell of sunny snow
Is swelling the icy air,—
The world grows bigger.

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of moon
To make the smell of apples
Light up the orchard.

<|endoftext|>

The chill autumn dusk
Grows colder as yellow lights
Come on in skyscrapers.

<|endoftext|>

Streaks of fire-flies
Freezing the magnolias
As white as ice.

<|endoftext|>

This September rain
Is much colder than the wind
That sweeps it along.

<|endoftext|>

The scent of an orange
By an ice-coated window
In a rocking train.

<|endoftext|>

An October night:
Rising from rain-wet shingles,
The cool scent of pine.

<|endoftext|>

The screech of shovels,
Scooping snow off the sidewalks
Deepens the cold.

<|endoftext|>

By night: “O how cold!”
But by daylight: “O how hot!”
Chanting peach blossoms.

<|endoftext|>

The metallic taste
Of a siren cutting through
The hot summer air.

<|endoftext|>

The grate of a saw
Hacking into a slab of ice
Is a death rattle.

<|endoftext|>

With intense effort
The blindman’s eyes are squinting:
How bitter the cold!

<|endoftext|>

The sun is as hot
As the big red carbuncle
On the fat man’s neck.

<|endoftext|>

A freezing morning: 
I left a bit of my skin
On the broomstick handle.

<|endoftext|>

A spring moon so round
That my fingers are itching
To touch its sharp edge.

<|endoftext|>

A freezing morning:
As sharp as an aching tooth,
A long icicle.

<|endoftext|>

A wailing siren
Scales up sheer skyscraper walls
In a blinding sun.

<|endoftext|>

This tiny pimple,
So sunny bright on my cheek,
Is bigger than
I am.

<|endoftext|>

As the bank teller
Jiggles a stack of silver,
I think of sparrows.

<|endoftext|>

The sound of a rat
Scampering over cold tin
Is heard in the bowels.

<|endoftext|>

A fly crawls slowly
Over a sticky paper,—
How chilly the dawn!

<|endoftext|>

Even my own shoes
Seem to become heavier
This warm spring morning.

<|endoftext|>

A chill autumn wind
Filling all the valley
With mountain voices.

<|endoftext|>

The sound of a snake
Slithering over dry leaves
Is as hot as fire.

<|endoftext|>

A descending fog
Is making an autumn day
Taste of buried years.

<|endoftext|>

On awakening,
I feel a cool autumn breeze
Blowing on my brow.

<|endoftext|>

A spring sky so clear
That you feel you are seeing
Into tomorrow.

<|endoftext|>

There is where I am: —
Summer sunset loneliness,
Purple meeting red.

<|endoftext|>

A balmy spring wind
Reminding me of something
I cannot recall.

<|endoftext|>

Lonelier than dew
On shriveled magnolias
Burnt black by the sun.

<|endoftext|>

This still afternoon
Is full of autumn sunlight
And spring memories.

<|endoftext|>

Dazzling summer sun!
But the smell of the past comes
With rain upon the dust.

<|endoftext|>

I feel autumn rain
Trying to explain something
I do not want to know.

<|endoftext|>

A sleepless spring night:
Yearning for what
I never had, And for what never was.

<|endoftext|>

She said she would come!
How yellow are these lilies!
How white is this sand!

<|endoftext|>

Rotting yellow leaves
Have about them an odor
Both of death and hope.

<|endoftext|>

The spring rain has blown
A shining little village
Upon a hillside.

<|endoftext|>

How melancholy
That these sweet magnolias
Cannot smell themselves.

<|endoftext|>

One, two, three stars
Breed a whole sky of stars,
Dyeing the night blue.

<|endoftext|>

Rustling dry paper
Sounding in an empty room
Is a cold mountain.

<|endoftext|>

In the setting sun, 
Yellow roses are waving
All their sharp wan thorns.

<|endoftext|>

In the silent forest
A woodpecker hammers at
The sound of silence.

<|endoftext|>

Shrilling sparrows
Are sheathing the waterfall
With glittering light.

<|endoftext|>

The fog’s density
Deepens the croak of the frogs
On an April dawn.

<|endoftext|>

How lonely it is:
A winter world fall of rain,
Rain raining on rain.

<|endoftext|>

A bay full of ships,
All arriving or leaving
On bright spring waves.

<|endoftext|>

The ocean’s soft sound
Lifts the toll of a far bell
To the half-seen stars.

<|endoftext|>

Blowing from the sky,
And being blown toward the sky,
— Wild snow in April.

<|endoftext|>

How lonely it is:
Black brittle cornstalks are snapping
In the winter blast.

<|endoftext|>

Only one faint star,
One yellow-windowed ship
And one heaving sea.

<|endoftext|>

Streaming on the hills,
Swirling past the horns of cows,
Steeply slanting snow.

<|endoftext|>

Spring rain from the south,
And then spring rain from the north,—
How the green corn glistens!

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of wind
To sway all the forest trees
In winter harmony.

<|endoftext|>

The round horizon
Is black save for a red ball
In the cold mountains.

<|endoftext|>

A little dog barks
At a roaring waterfall
That swallows his voice.

<|endoftext|>

White as it is young
And as black as it is dead,—
One magnolia!

<|endoftext|>

With her beak open,
A fat white hen is panting
In the August heat.

<|endoftext|>

While mounting a cow,
A bull ejaculates sperm
On apple blossoms.

<|endoftext|>

The neighing horses
Are causing echoing neighs
In neighboring barns.

<|endoftext|>

A lakeshore circus:
An elephant trumpeting
Waves on blue water.

<|endoftext|>

In an ice-wagon,
A snow-white pigeon sipping
Drops of cold water.

<|endoftext|>

Hidden by snowflakes,
A horse neighs excitedly
In a white silence.

<|endoftext|>

Blue-black beak open, 
The crow hurls a caw straight at
A sinking red sun.

<|endoftext|>

Tongue and tail drooping,
The dog trots in the noon-day sun,
Looking at nobody.

<|endoftext|>

A cathedral bell
Dimming the river water
In the autumn dusk.

<|endoftext|>

A bounding puppy
Chases a blue soap bubble
And barks when it bursts.

<|endoftext|>

The indentation
Made by her head on the pillow:
A heavy snowfall.

<|endoftext|>

A sinking red sun
Staining a snowy village:
A cock crows softly

<|endoftext|>

In winter twilight
A cawing crow flies over
A rain-wet village.

<|endoftext|>

Out of icy fog,
Advancing with its sharp horns,
A white-faced cow.

<|endoftext|>

The sad sound of hymns
Flooding on to autumn fields
In hazy moonlight.

<|endoftext|>

Throughout the spring night,
The intermittent hooting
Of an owl in the rain.

<|endoftext|>

As the sun dies down,
Last night’s dew is still sparkling
Upon the lilacs.

<|endoftext|>

A September fog,
Mute upon the empty porch
Of an empty house.

<|endoftext|>

A church bell at dusk:
The evening sun’s slanting rays
Dying on my wall.

<|endoftext|>

Through sifting snow.
The ghostly outline of ships
In the quiet harbor.

<|endoftext|>

Under a low sky
A boy walking with a dog
In the spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

Why do I listen
To each low of the cow
This still autumn night?

<|endoftext|>

Ascending swallows
Winging to cottony nests
In warm red clouds.

<|endoftext|>

Tossing pine trees
Lulling a village to sleep
In the winter dusk.

<|endoftext|>

An Indian summer
Heaps itself in tons of gold
Over Nigger Town.

<|endoftext|>

In the cathedral, 
In a lance of rosy light,
Clouds of lazy flies.

<|endoftext|>

Above a gray lake,
In skyscraper window panes,
A dying spring day.

<|endoftext|>

From out of the thickets
The sounds of trickling water
Fill the hazy fields.

<|endoftext|>

Subsiding spring waves
Continue their slow rhythm
In the swaying trees.

<|endoftext|>

A pink afterglow.
Behind nodding sunflowers
And the smell of mint.

<|endoftext|>

At slow intervals
The hospital’s lights wink out
In the summer rain.

<|endoftext|>

The drone of spring rain;
A lonely old woman strokes
The fur of her cat.

<|endoftext|>

A little girl stares,
Dewy eyes round with wonder,
At morning glories.

<|endoftext|>

Hurdy-gurdy sounds
Soften the glow of streetlamps
In the evening dusk.

<|endoftext|>

The Christmas season:
A whore is painting her lips
Larger than they are.

<|endoftext|>

A cow is licking,
With long slow strokes of her tongue,
Spring rain from her thigh.

<|endoftext|>

An old blindman
Playing a black violin
Amid fallen leaves.

<|endoftext|>

While she undresses,
A spring moon touches her breasts
For seven seconds.

<|endoftext|>

A tall sunflower
And a grinning little boy
With snaggled teeth.

<|endoftext|>

The baby’s hiccough
Dies down and the hum of flies
Fills the sunny room.

<|endoftext|>

A peg-legged man
Stumps about in the garden,
Pruning the roses.

<|endoftext|>

A dead green beetle
Bobbing on a flowing creek,
Beaten by spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

A hunchback carries
A big black umbrella
In the falling snow.

<|endoftext|>

Hands behind his back,
An old priest on the seashore
In the autumn sun.

<|endoftext|>

The first day of spring:
The servant wears her blonde hair
In a new manner.

<|endoftext|>

A newspaper boy
Shouts “Extra!” in the cool night:
Spring wind flaps his coat.

<|endoftext|>

In the winter dusk,
A thin girl leads a black cow
By a dragging rope.

<|endoftext|>

Upon crunching snow,
Childless mothers are searching
For cash customers.

<|endoftext|>

In a freezing haze
The lowing of distant cows
Fogs the window panes.

<|endoftext|>

In the sea-scented wind
A prostitute is laughing
With moon-glinting teeth.

<|endoftext|>

On the summer air,
Flowing like rich creamy milk,
The low of a cow.

<|endoftext|>

A valley village
Lies in the grip of moonlight:
How lonely it is.

<|endoftext|>

Softer than sound,
The moon-struck magnolias
On a still hot night.

<|endoftext|>

A dim yellow light
Glowing in a misty dawn
Makes a village cold.

<|endoftext|>

Squeezing his eyes shut,
The cat yawns as if about
To eat the spring world.

<|endoftext|>

A lost cat mews
In the sunset fleeciness
Of a cotton field.

<|endoftext|>

The low of a cow
Answers a train’s long whistle
In the summer dusk.

<|endoftext|>

Faint in summer haze,
The contours of green hills
Through clouds of flies.

<|endoftext|>

An autumn sunset
Casting shadows of tombstones
Over mounds of graves.

<|endoftext|>

The crowded harbor:
Soft lights are blazing at dawn
In a drizzling rain.

<|endoftext|>

The moon is over
The horns of a pregnant cow
In the April dusk.

<|endoftext|>

Through white cotton fields,
Lifting toward the sunset,
A golden river.

<|endoftext|>

An owl in moonlight
Perches on a sagging fence
In a summer field.

<|endoftext|>

From a far valley
Comes the faint bark of a dog
Over yellow leaves.

<|endoftext|>

The stars are dredging
The bottom of the spring river
For bits of blue steel.

<|endoftext|>

A Spanish village:
Flowers and gurgling water,—
How silent it is!

<|endoftext|>

Below hot wires
Throbbing with urgent appeals,
Poppies are blooming.

<|endoftext|>

The October wind
Has blown the moon to a bit
Of brittle brass.

<|endoftext|>

In the autumn woods
Mules grind juice from sugar cane
Under heavy clouds.

<|endoftext|>

Under swelling clouds
Cutlasses flash in the sun
Amid sugar cane.

<|endoftext|>

A thin mangy dog
Curls up to sleep in the dust
Of a moonlit road.

<|endoftext|>

In the summer storm
A window shade is flapping
In my neighbor’s house.

<|endoftext|>

A pregnant cat
Licking its fuzzy belly
In a warm drizzle.

<|endoftext|>

Out of autumn leaves,
An owl spits an angry hoot
At a dull-red moon.

<|endoftext|>

In a bar’s doorway,
Wiping his mouth in spring wind,
Seeing nobody.

<|endoftext|>

Over railroad ties,
Heat rushes from hot mountains
On an August day.

<|endoftext|>

In a light spring rain
An old woman is spitting
Into a handkerchief.

<|endoftext|>

A dead mouse floating
Atop a bucket of cream
In the dawn spring light.

<|endoftext|>

An icy drizzle
Slowly solidifying
All the city’s ash piles.

<|endoftext|>

In the falling snow
The thick wool of the sheep
Gives off a faint vapor.

<|endoftext|>

When the school bell sounds,
A momentary silence
Falls upon the birds.

<|endoftext|>

In this rented room
One more winter stands outside
My dirty window pane.

<|endoftext|>

Why does that peach tree,
Arrayed in its pink blossoms,
Stand so near the pond?

<|endoftext|>

A dog barks sharply
From the frozen black timbers
Of a burnt down house.

<|endoftext|>

In a drizzling rain,
In a flower shop’s doorway,
A girl sells herself.

<|endoftext|>

A shaggy brown dog
Squatting under winter trees,
Shitting in the rain.

<|endoftext|>

From a farmhouse porch,
A girl calls into the dusk
Over snowy fields.

<|endoftext|>

Whitecaps on the bay:
A broken signboard banging
In the April wind.

<|endoftext|>

In a hot valley,
White cattle standing as still
As their black shadows.

<|endoftext|>

A single letter
Fluttering in the mailbox:—
A gusty spring wind.

<|endoftext|>

This tenement room
In which I sweat this
August Has one buzzing fly.

<|endoftext|>

My cigarette glows
Without my lips touching it,—
A steady spring breeze.

<|endoftext|>

Settling on the screen
Of the crowded movie house,
A white butterfly.

<|endoftext|>

Bits of confetti
Spotting a black umbrella
In an April rain.

An empty sickbed:
An indented white pillow
In weak winter sun.

<|endoftext|>

A farmer’s daughter
Screams at a contrary cow
In the driving sleet.

<|endoftext|>

While crows are cawing,
Poppies are dutifully
Deepening their red.

<|endoftext|>

From a green hilltop,
One tolling cathedral bell
Tints the spring sky blue.

<|endoftext|>

Naked black children
Chasing down an alleyway
After a gray cat.

<|endoftext|>

Raindrops are tilting
Pink from magnolias
In the setting sun.

<|endoftext|>

Eating a red apple,
A little girl stares dreamily
At the autumn sea.

<|endoftext|>

A gust of spring wind
Lifts a girl’s white straw hat;
It floats on the lake.

<|endoftext|>

Across her freckled face
Flitting shadows of snowflakes
Make her blue eyes blink.

<|endoftext|>

A cock crows for dawn
And then a neighing horse tells
Of spring in his blood.

<|endoftext|>

Look, look, look!
These are all the violets
Left by last night’s rain!

<|endoftext|>

A nude fat woman
Stands over a kitchen stove,
Tasting applesauce.

<|endoftext|>

Through an open door,
Ruffling the skirts of the dolls,
A wind from spring hills.

<|endoftext|>

About the kitten,
Who sleeps in a round white ball,
Are yellow tulips.

<|endoftext|>

A church bell at dusk:
The evening sun’s slanting rays
Dying on my wall.

<|endoftext|>

Enough of spring rain
On the gutted country road
To fill wagon ruts.

<|endoftext|>

In the autumn dusk:
A faintly lighted window
And the smell of rain.

<|endoftext|>

Over yellow corn,
As muted as the sunset,
The low of a cow.

<|endoftext|>

Snowing on the lake,
Snowing on the limbs of elms,
Snowing on spring snow.

<|endoftext|>

When the letter came,
The autumn sea sounded sad
And the clouds stood still.

<|endoftext|>

A loud ticking clock
Sounds in rhythm with the heat
Of a long slow day.

<|endoftext|>

Sleepy bumble bees
Buzzing about plum blossoms
In the setting sun.

<|endoftext|>

An early dawn breeze
Blowing with slow tenderness
On tall sunflowers.

<|endoftext|>

A washerwoman
Dyes a tub of water blue,—
The sunlit spring wind!

<|endoftext|>

Announcing autumn,
One dry leaf taps with crisp sound
On my window pane.

<|endoftext|>

In a barbershop
The stench of soap and hair,—
A hot summer day!

<|endoftext|>

As though sleepwalking,
A gray cat crosses the sand
In yellow moonlight.

<|endoftext|>

A black woman sings:
Filling the sunlight with steam,
Bubbling molasses.

<|endoftext|>

The sound of a rat
Gnawing in the winter wall
Of a rented room.

<|endoftext|>

Waving red banners
Are whipping the clouds along
In a wild spring rain.

<|endoftext|>

The green cockleburs
Caught in the thick wooly hair
Of the black boy’s head.

<|endoftext|>

Is it possible
That those wildly cawing crows
Know it is sunset?

<|endoftext|>

A railroad station:
A crowd of summer children
Laughing in the rain.

<|endoftext|>

A tall pretty girl
Wearing a purple raincoat
In the month of
June.

<|endoftext|>

I am paying rent
For the lice in my cold room
And the moonlight too.

<|endoftext|>

Sunday’s church bell tolls
On a bright green sloping hill
Over grazing cows.

<|endoftext|>

Entering my town
In a heavy fall of snow,
I feel a stranger.

<|endoftext|>

A train roars past
The eternal green of fields
In a rush of steam.

<|endoftext|>

Of generations
Comes this wild red rose to me,
As I come to it.

<|endoftext|>

In a vast silence
A wooden gate is open
In a spring farmyard.

<|endoftext|>

Your cargo tonight,
Is it rain or hail or sleet,
Caravan of clouds?

<|endoftext|>

The sound of spring thunder,
As wide as the wet plain
Over which it rolls.

<|endoftext|>

A radiant moon
Shining on flood refugees
Crowded on a hill.

<|endoftext|>

I have lost my way
In a strange town at night,—
A sky of cold stars.

<|endoftext|>

The spring flood waters
Lap slowly at the doorsteps,—
A radiant moon.

<|endoftext|>

As I stand stock still,
A viper undulates past,
Unaware of me.

<|endoftext|>

Rushing to the gate
To give her her parasol:
The dawn stars were bright.

<|endoftext|>

Even the serpent,
Magically beautiful
In silver moonlight.

<|endoftext|>

Between today’s snow
And that which fell yesterday,
A night of bright stars.

<|endoftext|>

A white butterfly
Sits with slowly moving wings
On a dead black snake.

<|endoftext|>

Walking home alone
From the sporting arena:
A curve of spring moon.

<|endoftext|>

A rain-wet buzzard
Amid dripping magnolias
In the setting sun.

<|endoftext|>

On a bayonet,
And beyond the barbs of wire,—
A spring moon at dawn.

<|endoftext|>

Wisps of winter fog
Left by the streetsweeper’s broom
Along the gutters.

<|endoftext|>

Head bent in spring sun,
A dog whimpers now and then,
Licking his penis.

<|endoftext|>

Bolting the gate tight
Against all the autumn world,—
Save the fiery stars.

<|endoftext|>

Shut in the ice box,
A cricket chirps sleepily
In an alien winter.

<|endoftext|>

At a funeral,
Strands of filmy spider webs
On coffin flowers.

<|endoftext|>

Does the snail know that
The green leaf on which it sleeps
Is obeying the wind?

<|endoftext|>

The horse’s hot piss
Scalds a fragile nest of ants
In a sea of foam.

<|endoftext|>

After a great yawn,
The cat blinks his eyes and stares
Past the autumn sun.

<|endoftext|>

Two flies locked in love
Were hit by a newspaper
And died together.

<|endoftext|>

“What a huge snowflake!” But as
I spoke my hot breath
Made it disappear.

<|endoftext|>

As a big cloud melts, 
Smaller and whiter clouds appear
Deeper in the sky.

<|endoftext|>

Standing in the field,
I hear the whispering of
Snowflake to snowflake.

<|endoftext|>

Waking from a nap
And hearing summer rain falling,—
What else has happened?

<|endoftext|>

How lonely it is: 
A ram unskins his penis,
Shows the moon his teeth.

<|endoftext|>

When I turn about,
My shadow lies alongside
That of a scarecrow.

<|endoftext|>

Wetting everything,
Wafting unseen and unheard,
Misty winter rain.

<|endoftext|>

Turning a corner,
I duck my head to dodge
A new winter moon.

<|endoftext|>

Through the church window, 
Into the holy water,
A dry leaf flutters.

<|endoftext|>

Sowing turnip seed
And glancing up and seeing
That the sun has gone.

<|endoftext|>

A cool April breeze
Clears out the smoke of incense
From the cathedral.

<|endoftext|>

How lonely it is:
The snowstorm has made the world
The size of my yard.

<|endoftext|>

Just one lonely road
Stretching into the shadows
Of a summer night.

<|endoftext|>

The sport stadium: 
Every seat is taken
By whirling snowflakes.

<|endoftext|>

Autumn moonlight is
Deepening the emptiness
Of a country road.

<|endoftext|>

While the village sleeps, 
The autumn stars come and fade,
Leaving a thin mist.

<|endoftext|>

A long empty road
Under a lowering sky
In a winter dawn.

<|endoftext|>

Across the table cloth,
Ants are dragging a dead fly
In the evening sun.

<|endoftext|>

An empty canoe
Turning slowly on a river
In the autumn rain.

<|endoftext|>

Pathetically,
A moth haunts a moonlit patch
Of white-plastered wall.

<|endoftext|>

From out of nowhere,
A bird perches on a post,
And becomes a crow.

<|endoftext|>

It is September,
The month in which I was born;
And I have no thoughts.

<|endoftext|>

Tell me, Tin
Soldier, Of the spring daydreams you had
And never told me!

<|endoftext|>

With its first blossom,
The little apple tree brags:
“Look, look! Me too!”

<|endoftext|>

The fire in the grate
Lights up six dead soldiers,
And five standing.

<|endoftext|>

If pumpkins could talk,
I am sure that they would be
Reactionary!

<|endoftext|>

A toy railroad train
Stalled in a dusty station
By webs of spiders.

<|endoftext|>

“Say, Mr. Beetle,
Are you taking a detour
Crawling on my knee?”

<|endoftext|>

An old winter oak:
Once upon a time there was
A big black ogre …

<|endoftext|>

The lighted toy shop
Seen through a frozen window
Is another world.

<|endoftext|>

Like a big black giant
The child’s shadow grimaces
On the moonlit wall!

<|endoftext|>

Creamy plum blossoms:
Once upon a time there was
A pretty princess …

<|endoftext|>

Even my old friends
Seem like newly met strangers
In this first snowfall.

<|endoftext|>

O if I could live
In that house where a peach tree
Blooms in the rain!

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of snow
To make you look carefully
At familiar streets.

<|endoftext|>

My binoculars
Show me far across the bay,
Narcissus flowers.

<|endoftext|>

Just enough of snow
To make a strutting black cock
Unbelievable.

<|endoftext|>

A green postage stamp:
Blooming in an exotic land,
A far-away spring.

<|endoftext|>

Only the horses
Really know the exact hour
When snow fell last night.

<|endoftext|>

The arriving train
All decorated with snow
From another town.

<|endoftext|>

Would not green peppers
Make strangely lovely insects
If they sprouted legs?

<|endoftext|>

In the setting sun,
Red leaves upon yellow sand
And a silent sea.

<|endoftext|>

Fire-fly, why play here?
The boys and girls are in the backyard,
Waiting for you.

<|endoftext|>

My shadow was sad
When
I took it from the sand
Of the gleaming beach.

<|endoftext|>

O dark green melons,
Who shines your slick skins so smooth,
Making them mirrors?

<|endoftext|>

As my delegate,
My shadow imitates me
This first day of spring.

<|endoftext|>

What do they tell you
Each night, O winter moon,
Before they roll you out?

<|endoftext|>

A winter tempest
Has blown all the cloud stuffings
Right out of the moon.

<|endoftext|>

Has the day been long,
Morning, noon, and the cold night,
O open-eyed dolls?

<|endoftext|>

What did the moon hit
To make all those blue-green sparks
Shower in the sky?

<|endoftext|>

As silent as the snow
Sleeping in the cold moonlight
Of winter mountains.

<|endoftext|>

What giant spider spun
That gleaming web of fire-escapes
On wet tenements?

<|endoftext|>

Putting out the light,
The sound of the sleet hums sharper
Upon the tin roof.

<|endoftext|>

As dark spring clouds sag,
The white buildings on the beach
Seem to come closer.

<|endoftext|>

After the sermon,
The preacher’s voice is still heard
In the caws of crows.

<|endoftext|>

The dazzling spring sun
Dwindles the glittering sea
And shrinks the ships.

<|endoftext|>

“Let’s make a scarecrow!”
But after we had made it,
Our field grew smaller.

<|endoftext|>

The spring sun has set;
The lake in its loneliness
Draws near the mountain.

<|endoftext|>

The moon has gone down,
But its gleam is lingering
On magnolias.

<|endoftext|>

The sudden sunrise
Made the blooming apple tree
Distant and smaller.

<|endoftext|>

A layer of snow
Is pulling the mountains nearer,
Making them smaller.

<|endoftext|>

One caw of a crow
Tints all of the fallen leaves
A deeper yellow.

<|endoftext|>

A fluff of cotton
Floats up and is swallowed
By a vast white cloud.

<|endoftext|>

Summer mountains move
To let a sinking sun pass
To the other side.

<|endoftext|>

A black mountain peak
Is arching a summer sky
And its just-felt moon.

<|endoftext|>

A small spring island
Is being measured by a
Ribbon of ship smoke.

<|endoftext|>

Dazzling moonlight:
The shadows are as solid
As the dewy leaves.

<|endoftext|>

The summer rainstorm
Drenches chickens in the fields,
Making them smaller.

<|endoftext|>

So cold it is now
That the moon is frozen fast
To a pine tree limb.

<|endoftext|>

The big light in the fog
Was but a little lantern
When we came to it.

<|endoftext|>

The gale of autumn
Swept the trees clean of leaves
And drew the hills near.

<|endoftext|>

Gleaming yellow pears
Were never so translucent
As in this scant rain.

<|endoftext|>

Is this tiny pond
The great big lake in which
I swam as a boy?

<|endoftext|>

For seven seconds
The steam from the train whistle
Blew out the spring moon.

<|endoftext|>

An old lonely man
Had a long conversation
Late one winter night.

<|endoftext|>

A winter tempest
Is hurling the black-limbed trees
Swiftly past the moon.

<|endoftext|>

Could this melody
Be sung in other countries
By other birds?

<|endoftext|>

A hesitating sun
Turns a slow deep red and then
Falls into the wheat.

<|endoftext|>

A slow autumn rain:
The sad eyes of my mother
Fill a lonely night.

<|endoftext|>

Into the dim room
A butterfly flits and flees,—
But can still be seen.

<|endoftext|>

Bedraggled scarecrow,
What a time you must have had
In last night’s rainstorm!

<|endoftext|>

It is not outdoors
That the baby sparrow cheeps,
But here in the house!

<|endoftext|>

A thin waterfall
Dribbles the whole autumn night,—
How lonely it is.

<|endoftext|>

For what does she wait,
Huddled in the winter rain,
That young girl out there?

<|endoftext|>

From across the lake,
Past the black winter trees,
Faint sounds of a flute.

<|endoftext|>

What will these moths do
When the bright streetlamps wink out
And summer rain falls?

<|endoftext|>

Twisting violently,
A lost kite seeks its freedom
From telegraph wires.

<|endoftext|>

Standing in the crowd
In a cold drizzling rain,—
How lonely it is.

<|endoftext|>

Between wagon shafts,
A horse waits in a cold rain
With its head hung low.

<|endoftext|>

Calling and calling,
The faint voice of a sparrow
From the autumn rain.

<|endoftext|>

Scarecrow, who starved you,
Set you in that icy wind,
And then forgot you?

<|endoftext|>

In winter moonlight:
An empty railroad station
And one whining cat.

<|endoftext|>

Amid the daisies
Even the idiot boy
Has a dignity.

<|endoftext|>

My cold and damp feet
Feel as distant as the moon
On this autumn night.

<|endoftext|>

Don’t they make you sad,
Those wild geese winging southward,
O lonely scarecrow?

<|endoftext|>

A limping sparrow
Leaves on a white window sill
Lacy tracks of blood.

<|endoftext|>

A long winter rain:
A whistling old man whittles
A dream on a stick.

<|endoftext|>

From the rainy dark
Comes faint white cries of wild geese,—
How lonely it is.

<|endoftext|>

Suddenly one spring
She did not skip any more,
And her eyes grew grave.

<|endoftext|>

Under plum blossoms,
Just castrated rams have tears
Bulging in their eyes.

<|endoftext|>

In a damp attic,
Spilling out grains of sawdust,
A wounded rag doll.

<|endoftext|>

For six dark dank years,
A doll with a
Christmas smile
In an old shoe box.

<|endoftext|>

From the cattle truck,
An anxious cow is staring
At springtime streets.

<|endoftext|>

An old consumptive
Coughs so spasmodically
He disturbs the birds.

<|endoftext|>

A sick cat seeks out
A stiff and frozen willow
Under which to die.

<|endoftext|>

Sitting in spring rain,
Two forgotten rag dolls,
Their feet in water.

<|endoftext|>

Lighting on my fence,
The crow tosses me a glance,
Wipes his beak and goes.

<|endoftext|>

O Cat with Gray Eyes, 
Do you feel this autumn too,
Are you also sad?

<|endoftext|>

Two white butterflies
Fluttering over green grass:
One goes east, one west.

<|endoftext|>

A blue butterfly
Dips over a prison wall,
Then slowly returns.

<|endoftext|>

A slow encircling, 
Inquisitive butterfly
Follows the blindman.

<|endoftext|>

The blindman stumbles,
Pauses, then walks slower
Into the autumn night.

<|endoftext|>

She has departed:
All the globes of golden pears
Are pointed in pain.

<|endoftext|>

Crying out the end
Of a long summer’s sun,—
Departing wild geese.

<|endoftext|>

The train that took her
Steams into the autumn hills
And becomes silent.

<|endoftext|>

A slow creeping snail;
Moments later I could not
See it anywhere.

<|endoftext|>

The sound of a train
Fading in the autumn hills,—
And tomorrow too.

<|endoftext|>

Departing wild geese
Are fanning the moon brighter
With their tireless wings.

<|endoftext|>

Her train has now gone:
Where handkerchiefs were waving,
Moonlight on hot rails.

<|endoftext|>

I last saw her face
Under a dripping willow
In a windy rain.

<|endoftext|>

A cold winter sea
Blowing the hazy dawn stars
Higher and paler.

<|endoftext|>

One vanishing ship
On an autumn horizon:
How lonely it is.

<|endoftext|>

Black men with big brooms
Sweeping streets in falling snow,
Are absorbed by flakes.

<|endoftext|>

In the blazing sun
The sand rose from the desert
And fled with the wind.

<|endoftext|>

As the popcorn man
Is closing up his wagon,
Snow begins to fall.

<|endoftext|>

Above leafless trees,
A crow skims a dark brown hill
And heads for the sun.

<|endoftext|>

While plucking the goose,
A feather flew wildly off
To look for snowflakes.

<|endoftext|>

Like the day also,
Clouds are blown behind the hills
By a winter wind.

<|endoftext|>

Their watching faces,
As I walk the autumn road,
Make me a traveler.

<|endoftext|>

The snowball I threw
Was caught in a net of flakes
And wafted away.

<|endoftext|>

Starting a journey—
The scent of burning dry leaves
Stains the sky lonely.

<|endoftext|>

High above the ship
On which immigrants sail,
Are departing geese.

<|endoftext|>

As you leave the gate,
A skinny old dog barks once,
Then goes back to sleep.

<|endoftext|>

In the post office,
A clerk sorting out letters
Hears spring rain falling.

<|endoftext|>

A fleeing viper
Rippling rows of gold tassels
In a field of wheat.

<|endoftext|>

Pen me a letter
From where plum trees are blooming,
Pilgrimaging geese!

<|endoftext|>

Through the winter rain,
Calling to the scattered ships,
One floating sea gull.

<|endoftext|>

Running here and there,
Twisting down the winter stream,
A tiny red shoe.

<|endoftext|>

The caw of a crow:
On a distant summer field
Goes a silent train.

<|endoftext|>

Off the cherry tree, 
One twig and its red blossom
Flies into the sun.

<|endoftext|>

As early as
June, One yellow leaf flutters down,
Calling to its brothers.

<|endoftext|>

One umbrella
Entering into the woods
In a cold rain.

<|endoftext|>

An autumn fog stares
At a cat in a doorway,
Then steals slowly on.

<|endoftext|>

For each baptized,
The brown creek laughs and gurgles,
Flowing on its way.

<|endoftext|>

In a winter dawn,
Fleeing an opening door,
A scampering rat.

<|endoftext|>

In the rainy dark
A train screams at each village,
Then rolls on to the next.

<|endoftext|>

A steamboat’s whistle
Was blasted by the spring wind
To another town.

<|endoftext|>

Over gleaming snow,
Lashing the moon on its way,
One swaying treetop.

<|endoftext|>

An empty seashore:
Taking a long summer with it,
A departing train.

<|endoftext|>

How lonely it is:
A rattling freight train has left;
Fields of croaking frogs.

<|endoftext|>

Was it a young man
Who went into the graveyard
In the summer rain?

<|endoftext|>

In my sleep at night,
I keep pounding an anvil
Heard during the day.

<|endoftext|>

And also tonight,
The same evening star above
The same apple tree.

<|endoftext|>

The spring hills grow dim,
Today joining other days,
Days gone, days to come.

<|endoftext|>

Another day falls
Out of a rainy curtain
Of dark autumn days.

<|endoftext|>

It is as it is:
Yesterday’s spring rain falling
All night and today.

<|endoftext|>

In the autumn air,
Distant mountains are dreaming
Of autumns to come.

<|endoftext|>

How many autumns
Has this giant rock been host to
The moon and its light?

<|endoftext|>

You can see the wind
Absentmindedly fumbling
With apple blossoms.

<|endoftext|>

Defending themselves,
The green leaves beat back the rain,
Smashing it to mist.

<|endoftext|>

With nervous pleasure,
The tulips are receiving
A spring rain at dusk.

<|endoftext|>

The storm singles out
The tallest pine in the woods
And flays its branches.

<|endoftext|>

Under the first snow
Yellow leaves are surrendering
With faint dry whispers.

<|endoftext|>

The naked mountains,
Washing themselves in spring rain
As green fields look on.

<|endoftext|>

The spring dawn comes so fast
That the yellow streetlamps
Turn pale and grow shy.

<|endoftext|>

Between night and dawn,
A plum tree apologized
With profuse petals.

<|endoftext|>

The lake gulps spring rain,
Sucking the falling drops
With a million mouths.

<|endoftext|>

I wonder how long
Was that violet dancing
Before I saw it?

<|endoftext|>

In the autumn dusk
A spider patiently darns
A hole in a wall.

<|endoftext|>

In the summer dawn,
Before it has time to dress,
How sad the willow.

<|endoftext|>

Winter wind brings snow
And gives the cat a litter
Of spotted kittens.

<|endoftext|>

Golden afternoon:
Tree leaves are visiting me
In their yellow clothes.

<|endoftext|>

That sparrow bent down,
Its head tucked beneath its wing,—
Sewing a button?

<|endoftext|>

It is so hot that
The scarecrow has taken off
All his underwear!

<|endoftext|>

A leaf chases wind
Across an autumn river
And shakes a pine tree.

<|endoftext|>

Accidentally
Cut by the tip of the hoe,
The scarecrow shudders.

<|endoftext|>

A pale winter moon,
Pitying a lonely doll,
Lent it a shadow.

<|endoftext|>

When the horse whinnies,
The scarecrow waves both his arms,
Asking for silence.

<|endoftext|>

A flood of spring rain
Searching into drying grasses
Finds a lost doll.

<|endoftext|>

How it is bristling
Toward that big brassy sun,
This one sunflower.

<|endoftext|>

In rippling water
A short black broomstick handle
Is a runaway snake.

<|endoftext|>

After a meeting
Held in the corner garden,
The leaves scattered.

<|endoftext|>

A skinny scarecrow
And its skinnier shadow
Fleeing a cold moon.

<|endoftext|>

Turning here, there,
Leaping before sleety wind,
A lost yellow fan.

<|endoftext|>

Suddenly mindful,
The tree was looking at me,
Each green leaf alive.

<|endoftext|>

That fog standing there, 
Inspecting the store window,
Is white with envy.

<|endoftext|>

“Come out of the cold!”
A lighted window beckons
Through falling snow.

<|endoftext|>

August noon hour:
All the objects of the world
Digesting shadows.

<|endoftext|>

The cold is so sharp
That the shadow of the house
Bites into the snow.

<|endoftext|>

As my delegate,
The scarecrow looks pensively
Into spring moonlight.

<|endoftext|>

Jagged icicles
Are snapping off as they bite
Into the morning sun.

<|endoftext|>

A darting sparrow
Startles a skinny scarecrow
Back to watchfulness.

<|endoftext|>

Each moment or two
A long tongue of autumn wind
Licks the river white.

<|endoftext|>

The autumn river
Utters one long crow cry,
Then rustles again.

<|endoftext|>

His task completed,
The scarecrow watches the truck
Leave loaded with corn.

<|endoftext|>

And now once again
Winter wind breathes sighingly
Amid the pine trees.

<|endoftext|>

Made stiff by the sleet, 
The flag stands out from the pole,
Like a general.

<|endoftext|>

The ocean in
June: Inhaling and exhaling,
But never speaking.

<|endoftext|>

One sad, one shy,
Low on the spring horizon,
The sun and the moon.

<|endoftext|>

It was so silent
That the silence protested
With one lone bird cry.

<|endoftext|>

My decrepit barn
Sags full of self-consciousness
In this autumn sun.

<|endoftext|>

Having appointed
All the stars to their places,
The summer wind sleeps.

<|endoftext|>

Smoking brick chimneys
Belching up a misshapen moon
In an autumn haze.

<|endoftext|>

Black winter hills
Nibbling at the sinking sun
With stark stumpy teeth.

<|endoftext|>

Flitting through the trees,
Some snowflakes cling to the twigs,
Others flutter free.

<|endoftext|>

A dark forest plain
Is eagerly swallowing
Its first winter snow.

<|endoftext|>

The sticky snowflakes
Cling stubbornly to the broom
Brushing them away.

<|endoftext|>

The pennants are down,
But their black poles are boasting 
To the snowy fields.

<|endoftext|>

In tense dry panic,
A fallen leaf goes flying
Over other leaves.

<|endoftext|>

The scarecrow’s big sleeves
Advertising in the sun:
Huge, red tomatoes!

<|endoftext|>

On a scarecrow’s head,
A sparrow braces itself
Against the spring wind.

<|endoftext|>

Chattering dryly,
Yellow leaves are fleeing,
Huddling in corners.

<|endoftext|>

A shower of hail
Has beaten the spring moon thin
And flattened the lake.

<|endoftext|>

A wild winter wind
Is tearing itself to shreds
On barbed-wire fences.

<|endoftext|>

With the forest trees cut,
The lake lies naked and lost
In the bare hills.

<|endoftext|>

Light flakes of snow
Being driven from the sky
By one yellow rose.

<|endoftext|>

With solemnity
The magpies are dissecting
A cat’s dead body.

<|endoftext|>

The clouds are smiling
At a single yellow kite
Swaying under them.

<|endoftext|>

The creeping shadow
Of a gigantic oak tree
Jumps over the wall.

<|endoftext|>

He hesitated
Before hanging up his coat
On the scarecrow’s arm.

<|endoftext|>

Before blossoming,
A cherry bud looks eager,
As if about to speak.

<|endoftext|>

With mouth gaping wide,
Swallowing strings of wild geese,—
Hungry autumn moon.

<|endoftext|>

Backing off slowly,
The dog barks at a spring moon,
Just to make certain.

<|endoftext|>

While plowing the earth,
Hills that were invisible
Are now to be seen.

<|endoftext|>

Crystal April air:
A distant crow’s beak opens,
Then a lagging caw.

<|endoftext|>

A wilting jonquil
Journeys to its destiny
In a shut bedroom.

<|endoftext|>

As my anger ebbs,
The spring stars grow bright again
And the wind returns.

<|endoftext|>

Lines of winter rain
Gleam only as they flash past
My lighted window.

<|endoftext|>

In the afterglow
A snow-covered mountain peak
Sings of loneliness.

<|endoftext|>

As the stores are closing,
Yellow streetlamps spring to life
In an April fog.

<|endoftext|>

From a cotton field
To magnolia trees,
A bridge of swallows.

<|endoftext|>

In the April sun,
The top of a damp sand mound
Is slowly sifting.

<|endoftext|>

Hopping on the fence,
A sparrow casts its shadow
On a horse’s flank.

<|endoftext|>

Beneath pale stars,
Breathing wet on cattle horns,
A faint winter fog.

<|endoftext|>

Each ebbing sea wave
Makes pebbles glare at the moon,
Then fall back to sleep.

<|endoftext|>

From the cherry tree
To the roof of the red barn,
A cloud of sparrows flew.

<|endoftext|>

Even while sleeping,
The scabby little puppy
Scratches his fleas.

<|endoftext|>

In the summer rain
A spider clinging grimly
To a sunflower.

<|endoftext|>

In a dank basement
A rotting sack of barley
Swells with sprouting grain.

<|endoftext|>

A magnolia
Fell amid fighting sparrows,
Putting them to flight.

<|endoftext|>

Just before sunrise,
And after the milkman has gone,
A jonquil blooms.

<|endoftext|>

In the July sun,
Three birds flew into a nest;
Only two came out.

<|endoftext|>

In the summer sun,
Near an empty whiskey bottle,
A sleeping serpent.

<|endoftext|>

In the burning sun,
A viper’s tongue is nudging
A cigarette butt.

<|endoftext|>

Out of the forest
One bird cry comes over snow,
Then black silence.

<|endoftext|>

Drying in the sun,
Gleaming in a dirt pathway,
The track of a snail.

<|endoftext|>

In the vast desert,
The whisper of stirring sand
Deepens the silence.

<|endoftext|>

The sun is drying
Yellow leaves stuck on the wall
By last night’s rainstorm.

<|endoftext|>

In the still orchard
A petal falls to the grass;
A bird stops singing,

<|endoftext|>

Only where sunlight
Spots the table cloth with gold
Do the flies cluster.

<|endoftext|>

In the summer lake,
The moon gives a long shiver,
Then swells round again.

<|endoftext|>

Spring snow melting,
But under the dark hedges
Are patches of white.

<|endoftext|>

A crow calls out twice,
Then after a long silence
Calls out twice again.

<|endoftext|>

Three times a bird calls;
At last there comes a response,
Meek and far away.

<|endoftext|>

From the woods at night
Comes the sound of something walking
Over fallen leaves.

<|endoftext|>

The mailman’s whistle
Makes the weeping baby pause
And stare waitingly.

<|endoftext|>

During spring cleaning,
She comes across her old dolls
And stares musingly.

<|endoftext|>

How quiet it is when
The rain stops and changes
Into driving snow.

<|endoftext|>

I saw the dead man
Impatiently brash away
The flies from his mouth.

<|endoftext|>

While urinating,
I feel slightly self-conscious
Before the spring moon.

<|endoftext|>

A bloated dead cat
Emerging from melting snow
On a tenement roof.

<|endoftext|>

So insistently
A crow caws in the spring field
That I want to look.

<|endoftext|>

In a quiet forest,
Out of a pool of cold rain,
A rat laps the stars.

<|endoftext|>

Damp with autumnness,
On a dusty mantelpiece,
A porcelain hen.

<|endoftext|>

Like remembering,
The hills are dim and distant
In the winter air.

<|endoftext|>

An autumn river:
A crow with a broken wing,
Cawing as it floats.

<|endoftext|>

An autumn evening,
With all its somber joy,
Is a lonely thing.

<|endoftext|>

Droning autumn rain:
A boy lines up toy soldiers
For a big battle.

<|endoftext|>

Beyond a sea wall,
An occasional wave flings
Foam at the autumn sky.

<|endoftext|>

The oaken coffin,
Between the porch and the car,
Was christened by snow.

<|endoftext|>

On a glassy sea
There is not a single ship
In the August sun.

<|endoftext|>

Standing in the snow,
A horse shifts his heavy haunch
Slowly to the right.

<|endoftext|>

A moment ago
There was just one icy star
Above that mountain.

<|endoftext|>

This well-thumbed novel
Was the tale she loved best,—
Fields of autumn rain.

<|endoftext|>

The calliope fades,
But the autumn wind still echoes
Its tune in the street.

<|endoftext|>

My guests have now gone;
The grate fire burns to white ashes,—
How lonely it is.

<|endoftext|>

Waving pennants gone,
The white houses now belong
To a summer sky.

<|endoftext|>

The autumn wind moans:
I would like to talk to her,
If she were here now.

<|endoftext|>

The parade has gone:
A cloudy sky rests heavier
Upon the houses.

<|endoftext|>

On my trouser leg
Are still a few strands of fur
From my long dead cat.

<|endoftext|>

After the parade, 
And after the pounding drums,
Winter trees are distant.

<|endoftext|>

Empty autumn sky:
The bright circus tents have gone,
Taking their music.

<|endoftext|>

The wild geese have gone;
The hills over which they flew
Are grieving and black.

<|endoftext|>

Having sold his cows,
His wide green pasture becomes
A part of the world.

<|endoftext|>

The descending fog
Wipes out the foreign freighters
Anchored in the bay.

<|endoftext|>

The parade has gone,
But the pounding drums still sway
The magnolias.

<|endoftext|>

There is nobody
To watch the kitten playing
With the willow tip.

<|endoftext|>

From the dark still pines,
Not a breath of autumn wind
To ripple the lake.

<|endoftext|>

I cannot find it,
That very first violet
Seen from my window.

<|endoftext|>

In this dry orchard
There are no red ripe apples
Dripping with rain.

<|endoftext|>

I see nobody
Upon the muddy roadway
In autumn moonlight.

<|endoftext|>

In the winter dusk,
No trees are dotting the banks
Of the little river.

<|endoftext|>

This autumn evening
Is full of an empty sky
And one empty road.

<|endoftext|>

Around the tree trunk,
A kitten’s paw is flicking
At an absent mouse.

<|endoftext|>

In the spring hills,
My dog sits and stares at me,—
Just us two alone.

<|endoftext|>

In winter twilight
A black rat creeps along
A path in the snow.

<|endoftext|>

In deep deference
To the fluttering snowflakes,
The birds cheep softly.

<|endoftext|>

Does that sparrow know
That it is upon my roof
That he is hopping?

<|endoftext|>

Not even the cat
Could escape the sudden rain
From the July sky.

<|endoftext|>

After the snowstorm,
The cattle stands aimlessly,
Blinking at whiteness.

<|endoftext|>

A tolling church bell:
A rat rears in the moonlight
And stares at the steeple.

<|endoftext|>

Escaping spring rain,
Scuttling over a door sill,
A fuzzy spider.

<|endoftext|>

A freezing midnight:
An empty house creaks slightly,
Settling in the earth.

<|endoftext|>

Above corn tassels
Half lost in the evening’s haze,
A single frog’s croak.

<|endoftext|>

A caterpillar
Sleeping in his spotted skin
On a sunlit leaf.

<|endoftext|>

From under the house
My cat comes with dusty fur
And cobwebbed whiskers.

<|endoftext|>

In a full zinc tub,
Winter rain pelting a rat,
Floating and bloated.

<|endoftext|>

A cat is watching
The fog as it is rising
Out of frozen grass.

<|endoftext|>

That rotting plant
Must be something delicious
To that butterfly.

<|endoftext|>

The guard on duty
Sees all visitors except
The beads of spring dew.

<|endoftext|>

One crow on a limb;
Another goes to join him,
Then both fly away.

<|endoftext|>

The plow-split anthill
Reveals scurrying black cities
Under the horse’s tail.

<|endoftext|>

It was the first time
I had ever seen the rain
Blow a bird away.

<|endoftext|>

Moonlit stillness:
One sear leaf makes sixty fall
With a sighing hiss.

<|endoftext|>

Why did this spring wood
Grow so silent when
I came? What was happening?

<|endoftext|>

That frozen star there,
Or this one on the water,—
Which is more distant?

<|endoftext|>

All the long spring day
Poplar trees flinging raindrops
Against sunlit clouds.

<|endoftext|>

Blossoming purple,
A forgotten artichoke
In a dark cupboard.

<|endoftext|>

A winter dawn breathes
Tiny beads of sweat on a
Sooty oil-lamp globe.

<|endoftext|>

Clutching from the trees,
Thick creepers are strangling clouds
In the lake’s bosom.

<|endoftext|>

Glittering with frost,
A dead frog squats livingly
In the garden path.

<|endoftext|>

Heading toward the sea,
Drifting into the cold rain,—
How strong the smoke is!

<|endoftext|>

On a scaly oak,
In the glare of sunset rays,
Ice on eagle’s wings.
