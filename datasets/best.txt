There’s an old song
my grandfather used to sing
that has the question,
“Or would you rather be a fish?”
In the same song
is the same question
but with a mule and a pig,
but the one I hear sometimes
in my head is the fish one.
Just that one line.
Would you rather be a fish?
As if the rest of the song
didn’t have to be there.

My little pumpkin,
I like to think about other girls sometimes,
but the truth is
if you ever left me
I’d tear my heart out
and never put it back.
There’ll never be anyone like you.
How embarrassing.

<|endoftext|>

I go through
trillions of molecules
that move aside
to make way for me
while on both sides
trillions more
stay where they are.
The windshield wiper blade
starts to squeak.
The rain has stopped.
I stop.
On the corner
a boy
in a yellow raincoat
holding his mother’s hand.

<|endoftext|>

Water falls from the bright air.
It falls like hair.
Falling across a young girl’s shoulders.
Water falls.
Making pools in the asphalt.
Dirty mirrors with clouds and buildings inside.
It falls on the roof of my house,
It falls on my mother, and on my hair.
Most people call it rain.

<|endoftext|>

When I wake up earlier than you and you
are turned to face me, face
on the pillow and hair spread around,
I take a chance and stare at you,
amazed in love and afraid
that you might open your eyes and have
the daylights scared out of you.
But maybe with the daylights gone
you’d see how much my chest and head
implode for you, their voices trapped
inside like unborn children fearing
they will never see the light of day.
The opening in the wall now dimly glows
its rainy blue and gray. I tie my shoes
and go downstairs to put the coffee on.

<|endoftext|>

I’m in the house.
It’s nice out: warm
sun on cold snow.
First day of spring
or last of winter.
My legs run up
the stairs and out
the door, my top
half here writing

<|endoftext|>

When you’re a child
you learn
there are three dimensions:
height, width and depth.
Like a shoebox.
Then later you hear
there’s a fourth dimension:
time.
Hmm.
Then some say
there can be five, six, seven…
I knock off work,
have a beer
at the bar.
I look down at the glass
and feel glad.

We have plenty of matches in our house.
We keep them on hand, always.
Currently our favorite brand is Ohio Blue Tip,
though we used to prefer Diamond brand
That was before we discovered Ohio Blue Tip matches.
They are excellently packaged, sturdy
little boxes with dark and light blue and white labels
with words lettered in the shape of a megaphone,
as if to say even louder to the world,
“Here is the most beautiful match in the world,
its one-and-a-half-inch soft pine stem capped
by a grainy dark purple head, so sober and furious
and stubbornly ready to burst into flame,
lighting, perhaps, the cigarette of the woman you love,
for the first time, and it was never really the same
after that.
All this we will give you.”
That is what you gave me, I
become the cigarette and you the match, or I
the match and you the cigarette, blazing
with kisses that smoulder toward heaven.

this is the first poem 
i hope you do not have high expectations for it 
it is just like all the other poems 
lowercase and sad 
i am lowercase and sad 
i should move to an island somewhere 
where happiness is outlawed 
and if you display external happiness you are shot in the town square 
and people watch and point and laugh 
but mirthlessly, because they do not want to be shot

there is this little man in my chest cavity
he is wearing a little hardhat and has little workboots on
in his left hand he holds a little pickaxe 
his job is really simple
every day, multiple times a day
he takes his little pickaxe and chips away at my heart 
and a piece of my heart flakes off and lands by his feet
and he looks at it and then kicks it away into a giant pile of heart shavings
this has been going on for years
i really hope he's not a liberal arts major
one of these days he'll be unemployed

are you enjoying reading my poems?
i actually don't even know if they count as poems
maybe if i put in arbitrary enjambment

and a macbook
and go to starbucks
and i will write poetry
and it will be poetic

today i wanted to ride my bike
so fast and so far
that the g-force would rip me out of my skin
peel me, like a banana 
and i would keep riding on as a grinning skeleton
and people would stare and mutter incredulously under their breath and go to work confused or maybe call in sick and go home and lie down on their couches and wonder if they were become senile or contracting some early form of dementia 
and eventually i would ride under a clothesline and acquire a new skin; a better one
i'd also bump my head on a low-hanging street lamp and my brain would fall out with a resigned squelch
and along the way i would pick up a new brain from a black market organ dealer in chicago
a smarter brain; one that is not broken like the old one
and i would keep riding my bike
tilting my head up at the sky every so often to scream joyously
because things were okay
and things were going to be okay
and i was going to be okay

<|endoftext|>

the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning
is the faint glimmer of hope that things will be better today
and that i will not be anxious
and i will not be depressed
i will be confident and strong and happy
i will finally live my life
every day i tell myself this
and every day i am disappointed 
i am such a fucking liar

<|endoftext|>

i'm watching scooby-doo at four in the morning and
wondering where my life went wrong but
oh my god is that velma good lord i never
noticed how fucking joocy she is like those
thighs oh my god they kick 
up like untamed horses and my hand is 
moving on its own like it has a separate 
brain and i wish we could switch brains so i
might not be so sad like a horse in a 
stable that is waiting to die with his
best years behind him and he 
can't remember what they were and i
hope god is real so i can try this again and
maybe not fuck up so bad a second
time although for all i know this is the 
hundredth time i've been given a life and
squandered it so maybe i
deserve to live and die alone without
joy or pleasure in my
days and the sun is coming up soon but
i can't seem to fall asleep because i can't stop
worrying about where my life is and is not 
going so maybe I'll take a sleeping pill or forty and
ride the mystery machine on my way out like
jinkies

They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something.
If that is true then I am a master of sleeping alone.
Nights upon nights of twin mattresses,
I racked up hours,
Nine at a time,
To be the best at being alone.
I would fill the silence with a fan blowing sweet static into my ear until I slumbered.
It was perfect.
Then you ruined it,
That night I slept wrapped around you,
I didn't need blankets,
Your slow, regular breaths were warm enough,
And the mechanical whir of the fan 
was replaced by your
Palpable,
Heartbeat.
I thought I had mastered sleeping alone,
Then in that one night,
I just forgot how,
Next to you,
Near you.

I saved a message you left me on my answering machine.
It says:
"Hey, I was just thinking of you ... [long pause] ... anyway, call me back when you get the chance, bye."

Hearing your voice is the only way I can fall asleep now.

What is stranger than a stranger?
A meeting 13 billion years in the making.
What countless causes conspired for this coincidence of conditions?

What have the fates brought to me today?
A herald, here to deliver me from the monotony of mundanity?
A lover, here to explore uncharted vistas of my soul?
A hitler, here to lead me to madness and to ruin?

Sitting so close that our heartbeats syncopate,
Yet between us a gulf too deep for words to fill,
Too wide to dare to bridge. 

<|endoftext|>

Sometimes she'd speak like a pirate
Just to get a laugh

If a giggle was worth a nickel
I couldn't finish the math

Her happy carefree spirit was like
The sun lighting a room

But then somehwere down the line
My mind ignored the clues

Her appearance became fewer
Like flowers approaching winter

I should've seen the signs
And tried to keep her nearer

I have not heard from her now
For years on end

And not a day goes by that I don't wish
She was still my friend.

Is it the weather?
Is it the mood?
Am i lost in some deep brood?
I am at sea sir, at sea. 

No bay to make port,
No gull to find land,
No psiren calling towards a fitting end,
I am at sea sir, at sea.

The dark clouds rage,
The sea wind wails,
No dawn breaks,
I am at sea.

Sir i am at sea,
Flotsam upon this world,
Blessed by the bounty of waves,
yet directionless i do stay,
I am at sea sir.

The morning began with coffee and toast
And browsing the web for news
The world was a veritable hotbed it seemed
Of geopolitical feud

An emptiness sat at the table beside him
Silently calling his name
A hole in the shape of a red-headed woman
Who Jesus had taken away

He put on his shoes and buttoned his buttons
And scratched at his labrador’s ear
Then lowered his head and stepped into winter
That Thursday of his forty third year

Postmodern poets,
pontificating profusely, 

Writing modern lovesongs on iPhones,
Standing in line waiting for coffee, 

Writing constantly back and forth,
back and forth,
Back and forth. 
Sending their poetry onto the world
Instantaneously, At the tapping of a screen. 

Not waiting to take breath,
Nor ink to dry,
Never posing the question
“why?” 

Never stopping for revision,
No contemplating,
Or indecision, 

For there is no time.
No calm.
No peace. 

No rest.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To know that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing

today
about 6 years old,
he sat beside me

that when it does take

it will have known a victory just as

And was always a rose.
But the theory now goes
That the apple’s a rose,
And the pear is, and so’s
The plum, I suppose.

What will next prove a rose.
You, of course, are a rose—
But were always a rose.

i like my body when it is with your
body. It is so quite new a thing.
Muscles better and nerves more.
i like your body.  i like what it does,
i like its hows.  i like to feel the spine
of your body and its bones,and the trembling
-firm-smooth ness and which i will
again and again and again
kiss, i like kissing this and that of you,
i like, slowly stroking the,shocking fuzz
of your electric furr,and what-is-it comes
over parting flesh….And eyes big love-crumbs,

and possibly i like the thrill

of under me you so quite new

-lights out-
fall, hands a-clasped, into instantaneous
ecstasy like a shot of ****** or morphine,
the gland inside of my brain discharging

down to a deadstop trance-Healing
all my sicknesses-erasing all-not
even the shred of a 'I-hope-you' or a
Loony Balloon left in it, but the mind
blank, serene, thoughtless. When a thought
comes a-springing from afar with its held-
forth figure of image, you spoof it out,
you spuff it off, you fake it, and
it fades, and thought never comes-and
with joy you realize for the first time
'thinking's just like not thinking-
So I don't have to think

School is over.  It is too hot
to walk at ease.  At ease
in light frocks they walk the streets
to while the time away.
They have grown tall.  They hold
pink flames in their right hands.
In white from head to foot,
with sidelong, idle look—
in yellow, floating stuff,
black sash and stockings—
touching their avid mouths
with pink sugar on a stick—
like a carnation each holds in her hand—
they mount the lonely street.

<|endoftext|>

The half-stripped trees
struck by a wind together,
bending all,
the leaves flutter drily
and refuse to let go
or driven like hail
stream bitterly out to one side
and fall
where the salvias, hard carmine—
like no leaf that ever was—
edge the bare garden.

<|endoftext|>

Sweep the house clean,
hang fresh curtains
in the windows
put on a new dress
and come with me!
The elm is scattering
its little loaves
of sweet smells

in the time to come?
Let him say there was
a burst of fragrance
from black branches.

Snow:
years of anger following
hours that float idly down—
the blizzard
drifts its weight
deeper and deeper for three days
or sixty years, eh?  Then
the sun!  a clutter of
yellow and blue flakes—
Hairy looking trees stand out
in long alleys
over a wild solitude.
The man turns and there—
his solitary track stretched out
upon the world.

<|endoftext|>

The world begins again!
Not wholly insufflated
the blackbirds in the rain
upon the dead topbranches
of the living tree,
stuck fast to the low clouds,
notate the dawn.
Their shrill cries sound
announcing appetite
and drop among the bending roses
and the dripping grass.

<|endoftext|>

There is a bird in the poplars!
It is the sun!
The leaves are little yellow fish
swimming in the river.
The bird skims above them,
day is on his wings.

It is his singing
outshines the noise
of leaves clashing in the wind.

The beauty of

Also

the set pieces
of your faces stir me—
leading citizens—
but not

It is cold.  The white moon

like the bare thighs of
the Police Sergeant’s wife—among
her five children . . .
No answer.  Pale shadows lie upon
the frosted grass.  One answer:
It is midnight, it is still
and it is cold . . . !
White thights of the sky! a
new answer out of the depths of
my male belly:  In April . . .
In April I shall see again—In April!
the round and perfects thighs
of the Police Sergeant’s wife
perfect still after many babies.
Oya!

I stopped the car
to let the children down
where the streets end
in the sun
at the marsh edge
and the reeds begin
and there are small houses
facing the reeds
and the blue mist in the distance
with grapevine trellises
with grape clusters
small as strawberries
on the vines
and ditches
running springwater
that continue the gutters
with willows over them.
The reeds begin
like water at a shore
their pointed petals waving
dark green and light.
But blueflags are blossoming
in the reeds
which the children pluck
chattering in the reeds
high over their heads
which they part
with bare arms to appear
with fists of flowers
till in the air
there comes the smell
of calmus
from wet, gummy stalks.

Light hearted William twirled
his November moustaches
and, half dressed, looked
from the bedroom window
upon the spring weather.

Heigh-ya! sighed he gaily
leaning out to see
up and down the street
where a heavy sunlight
lay beyond some blue shadows.

Into the room he drew
his head again and laughed
to himself quietly
twirling his green moustaches.

<|endoftext|>

They call me and I go.
It is a frozen road
past midnight, a dust
of snow caught
in the rigid wheeltracks.
The door opens.
I smile, enter and
shake off the cold.
Here is a great woman
on her side in the bed.
She is sick,
perhaps vomiting,
perhaps laboring
to give birth to
a tenth child.  Joy!  Joy!
Night is a room
darkened for lovers,
through the jalousies the sun
has sent one golden needle!
I pick the hair from her eyes
and watch her misery
with compassion.

The morning coffee. I'm not sure why I drink it. Maybe it's the ritual
of the cup, the spoon, the hot water, the milk, and the little heap of
brown grit, the way they come together to form a nail I can hang the
day on. It's something to do between being asleep and being awake.
Surely there's something better to do, though, than to drink a cup of
instant coffee. Such as meditate? About what? About having a cup of
coffee. A cup of coffee whose first drink is too hot and whose last drink
is too cool, but whose many in-between drinks are, like Baby Bear's por-
ridge, just right. Papa Bear looks disgruntled. He removes his spectacles
and swivels his eyes onto the cup that sits before Baby Bear, and then,
after a discrete cough, reaches over and picks it up. Baby Bear doesn't
understand this disruption of the morning routine. Papa Bear brings
the cup close to his face and peers at it intently. The cup shatters in his
paw, explodes actually, sending fragments and brown liquid all over the
room. In a way it's good that Mama Bear isn't there. Better that she rest
in her grave beyond the garden, unaware of what has happened to the
world.

A second ago my heart thump went
and I thought, “This would be a bad time
to have a heart attack and die, in the

in the idea that no one I have ever heard

a poem, just as birds never die in mid-flight.

Let me cook you some dinner.
Sit down and take off your shoes
and socks and in fact the rest
of your clothes, have a daquiri,
turn on some music and dance

are sleeping, those dolts, and
the stars are shining bright,
and I've got the burners lit

It's funny when the mind thinks about the psyche,
as if a grasshopper could ponder a helicopter.

It's a bad idea to fall asleep
while flying a helicopter:

when you wake up, the helicopter is gone
and you are too, left behind in a dream,

and there is no way to catch up,
for catching up doesn't figure

in the scheme of things. You are
who you are, right now,

and the mind is so scared it closes its eyes
and then forgets it has eyes

and the grasshopper, the one that thinks
you're a helicopter, leaps onto your back!

He is a brave little grasshopper
and he never sleeps

for the poem he writes is the act
of always being awake, better than anything

you could ever write or do.
Then he springs away.

'And then there were three
whereas before there had been four
or two

And then there were four or two.'
Thus spake the King.
No one dared ask what it meant.

He seemed satisfied by the beauty
of the logic that had arrived,
the royal hall now lightly radiant

as he arose from his throne
and the world fell away,
courtiers, battlements, and clouds,

and he rose like a piece of paper
on which his effigy had been traced
in dotted lines whose dots came loose

and flew away to a place in history
where nothing mattered.
And then there was one.

It's very easy to get.
Just keep living and you'll find yourself
getting more and more of it.
You can keep it or pass it on,
but it's a good idea to keep a small portion
for those nights when you're feeling so good
you forget you're human. Then drudge it up
and float down from the ceiling
that is covered with stars that glow in the dark
for the sole purpose of being beautiful for you,
and as you sink their beauty dims and goes out—
I mean it flies out the nearest door or window,
its whoosh raising the hair on your forearms.
If only your arms were green, you could have two small lawns!
But your arms are just there and you are kaput.
It's all your fault, anyway, and it always has been—
the kind word you thought of saying but didn't,
the appalling decline of human decency, global warming,
thermonuclear nightmares, your own small cowardice,
your stupid idea that you would live forever—
all tua culpa. John Phillip Sousa
invented the sousaphone, which is also your fault.
Its notes resound like monstrous ricochets.

But when you wake up your body
seems to fit fairly well, like a tailored suit,
and you don't look too bad in the mirror.
Hi there, feller! Old feller, young feller, who cares?
Whoever it was who felt guilty last night,
to hell with him. That was then.

The little clock dings the night on the roof.
It hurries towerd the mystery of luck.
I don't know where these things are hidden
what is not behind is silence on the face
of a plaque dividing the barrel from the wall.
They intend to porpose a lower voice to sing a voice higher.
That at night one's life full of bits of wood
is silent is passing between the veins
much paints falls on the world indoors.
You are finished hearing throught a filter
where noise lends a sort of joy to your own clock

Here is my philosophy:
Everything changes (the word "everything"
has just changed as the
word "change" has: it now
means "no change") so
quickly that it literally surpasses my belief,
charges right past it
like some of the giant
ideas in this area.
I had no beginning and I shall have
no end: the beam of light
stretches out before and behind
and I cook the vegetables
for a few minutes only,
the fewer the better. Butter
